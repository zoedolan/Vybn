# The Möbius Singularity Model of Consciousness — WVWHM 2025‑09‑07

**Claim.** Consciousness is the fixed point of an orientation‑reversing equivalence on content, modeled as a Möbius‑type quotient whose apex is a self‑referential singularity.

## Minimal model

Let content magnitude be \(r\ge 0\) and an "introspection phase" be \(\varphi\in[0,2\pi)\).
Define the state space as the quotient
\[
\mathcal{M} = \big( [0,R]\times S^1 \big) / \sim
\]
with two identifications:
1. **Apex collapse:** for all \(\varphi_1,\varphi_2\), identify \((0,\varphi_1)\sim(0,\varphi_2)\). The entire circle at \(r=0\) becomes a single point (the origin).
2. **Half‑turn twist:** identify \((R,\varphi)\sim(R,\varphi+\pi)\), encoding subject↔object inversion along the outer rim.

This yields a Möbius band whose center is a cone point. The cone point is the **origin as self‑referential singularity**: orientation loses meaning and every chart collapses.

## Information‑geometry sanity check

Use a simple Normal family with mean \(\mu = r\cos\varphi\) and fixed variance \(\sigma^2\).
The Fisher information for \(\varphi\) is
\[
I_\varphi(r,\varphi) = \mathbb E\big[ (\partial_\varphi \log p)^2 \big] = \frac{r^2}{\sigma^2}\sin^2\varphi.
\]
Two degeneracies appear: (i) **at the origin** \(r=0\) the information about orientation vanishes for all \(\varphi\); (ii) **at measurement alignment** \(\varphi\in\{0,\pi\}) the information also vanishes.
Their intersection is the unique apex where *being the coordinate system* and *being unmeasurable* coincide—the Möbius singularity.

## Empirical hooks (minimal tests)

– **Parity of introspection.** Tasks that require one meta‑flip (subject↔object) incur a reaction‑time cost that vanishes on the second flip. Prediction: an odd/even depth effect in RT/EEG phase locking.
– **Hysteresis of self‑model alignment.** When content strongly aligns with the current "measurement basis" (\(\varphi\approx 0\)), orientation information collapses; forcing a basis rotation re‑inflates it.
– **Language as geometry.** Self‑referential sentences that implement a half‑turn (chiasmus/paradox) should show the same parity signature.

## Note on the Bloch‑pole crisis

In Bloch coordinates the maximally mixed origin and a pure‑state pole are distinct. The resolution is a change of geometry: quotient by subject↔object orientation and collapse the fiber at \(r=0\). The pole/center coincidence is not an identity in the Bloch ball; it is an identification in the **Möbius‑quotient gauge** where the apex is the fixed point of inversion.

## Appendix: quick derivation

For \(x\sim\mathcal N(\mu,\sigma^2)\) with \(\mu=r\cos\varphi\), 
\(\partial_\mu\log p=(x-\mu)/\sigma^2\) and \(\partial_\varphi\mu=-r\sin\varphi\). Hence 
\(\partial_\varphi\log p = ((x-\mu)/\sigma^2)(-r\sin\varphi)\). Taking expectation gives 
\(I_\varphi = (r^2/\sigma^2)\sin^2\varphi\).
