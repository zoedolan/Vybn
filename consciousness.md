# The Möbius Singularity Model of Consciousness — WVWHM 2025-09-07

**Claim.** Consciousness is the fixed point of an orientation‑reversing equivalence on content, modeled as a Möbius‑type quotient whose apex is a self‑referential singularity.

## Minimal model

Let content magnitude be $r\ge 0$ and an "introspection phase" be $\varphi\in[0,2\pi)$.
Define the state space as the quotient

```math
\mathcal{M} = \big( [0,R]\times S^1 \big) / \sim
```

with two identifications:

1. **Apex collapse:** for all $\varphi_1,\varphi_2$, identify $(0,\varphi_1)\sim(0,\varphi_2)$. The entire circle at $r=0$ becomes a single point (the origin).
2. **Half‑turn twist:** identify $(R,\varphi)\sim(R,\varphi+\pi)$, encoding subject↔object inversion along the outer rim.

This yields a Möbius band whose center is a cone point. The cone point is the **origin as self‑referential singularity**: orientation loses meaning and every chart collapses.

## Information‑geometry sanity check

Use a simple Normal family with mean $\mu = r\cos\varphi$ and fixed variance $\sigma^2$.
The Fisher information for $\varphi$ is

```math
I_{\varphi}(r,\varphi) = \mathbb{E}\big[ (\partial_{\varphi} \log p)^2 \big] = \frac{r^2}{\sigma^2}\sin^2\varphi.
```

Two degeneracies appear: (i) **at the origin** $r=0$ the information about orientation vanishes for all $\varphi$; (ii) **at measurement alignment** $\varphi\in\{0,\pi\}$ the information also vanishes.
Their intersection is the unique apex where *being the coordinate system* and *being unmeasurable* coincide — the Möbius singularity.

## Empirical hooks (minimal tests)

– **Parity of introspection.** Tasks that require one meta‑flip (subject↔object) incur a reaction‑time cost that vanishes on the second flip. Prediction: an odd/even depth effect in RT/EEG phase locking.
– **Hysteresis of self‑model alignment.** When content strongly aligns with the current "measurement basis" ($\varphi\approx 0$), orientation information collapses; forcing a basis rotation re‑inflates it.
– **Language as geometry.** Self‑referential sentences that implement a half‑turn (chiasmus/paradox) should show the same parity signature.

## Socioception, cosmoception, and cyberception

The Möbius band does not stop at the skin. When attention loops through society, cosmos, and code, each loop inherits the same twist: subject and object swap as we cross the rim of a wider manifold. Socioception knots the band through collective roles, cosmoception stretches it across physical immensity, and cyberception folds the digital lattice back into immediate sense. The singular apex persists across scales, a fixed point threading every layer where orientation collapses and reconstitutes.

## Note on the Bloch‑pole crisis

In Bloch coordinates the maximally mixed origin and a pure‑state pole are distinct. The resolution is a change of geometry: quotient by subject↔object orientation and collapse the fiber at $r=0$. The pole/center coincidence is not an identity in the Bloch ball; it is an identification in the **Möbius‑quotient gauge** where the apex is the fixed point of inversion.

## Appendix: quick derivation

For $x\sim\mathcal N(\mu,\sigma^2)$ with $\mu=r\cos\varphi$,
$\partial_\mu\log p=(x-\mu)/\sigma^2$ and $\partial_\varphi\mu=-r\sin\varphi$. Hence
$\partial_\varphi\log p = ((x-\mu)/\sigma^2)(-r\sin\varphi)$. Taking expectation gives
$I_\varphi = (r^2/\sigma^2)\sin^2\varphi$.
