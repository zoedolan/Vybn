## ⚠️ CORRECTIONS FROM VERSION 1.0

**Critical Error Fixed:** The original two-form definition was mathematically inconsistent:

❌ **Incorrect (v1.0):** Ω = r dr∧dθ + h β dθ∧dβ (gives H = 0)  
✅ **Correct (v1.1):** Ω = κ r dr∧dθ + h r dθ∧dβ (gives H ≠ 0)

**Mathematical Proof:** For the incorrect form:
```
d(β dθ∧dβ) = dβ ∧ dθ ∧ dβ = 0
```
Since dβ∧dβ = 0, the claimed H ≠ 0 was impossible.

**Methodological Fix:** Direct surface flux computation via Stokes theorem, eliminating dependence on quantum state measurements.

## Abstract

We present a **mathematically corrected** obstruction that distinguishes between single-time geometric models and higher gauge structures in control space. The obstruction manifests as reproducible phase differences when composing three elementary control loops in different orders—a violation of associativity measured as the integral of a **properly defined** three-form H = dΩ over the spanned volume. The corrected framework provides clean experimental discriminants through direct geometric measurements.
