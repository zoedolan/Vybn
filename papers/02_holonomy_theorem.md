## Abstract

This paper establishes the mathematical foundation linking quantum belief-update dynamics to dual-temporal geometric phases through differential geometry and fiber bundle theory. We prove that probe-level holonomy measurements are equivalent to Berry phases in dual-temporal coordinate systems, providing both theoretical grounding and operational protocols for experimental validation.

## Core Theorem

**Theorem (Dual-Temporal Holonomy = Probe-Level Belief-Update Holonomy).**

Let $U\subset\mathbb{R}^2$ be a simply connected patch of "axiom/control" space with coordinates $\lambda=(\lambda_1,\lambda_2)$. Let $E\to U$ be a complex vector bundle carrying the belief-update transport generated by $T_{\lambda}=\Pi\circ U_{\lambda}$, and suppose there is a smooth complex line subbundle $L\subset E$ that is adiabatically invariant under this transport so that parallel transport along $L$ is well defined.

Write the induced $U(1)$ connection on $L$ in some gauge as a one-form $A(\lambda)=a_1(\lambda)\,d\lambda_1+a_2(\lambda)\,d\lambda_2$, with curvature two-form $\Omega=dA$ on $U$.

Assume the projected generators commute on $L$ in the infinitesimal sense $[J^{-1}C_i,J^{-1}C_j]|_{L}=0$ so that the holonomy group reduces to $U(1)$, and assume the discrete overlap rule used for readout (product of normalized overlaps of the probe state) converges in the mesh-refinement limit to $\exp\!\big(i\!\oint A\big)$.

**Then there exists a local diffeomorphism** $\phi:U\to X$ onto a patch $X\subset \mathbb{R}_{>0}\times S^1$ with coordinates $(r_t,\theta_t)$ and a constant $E>0$ such that the curvature pulls back to the canonical "dual-temporal" form

$$
\Omega = \phi^{*}\!\Big(\frac{E}{\hbar}\,dr_t\wedge d\theta_t\Big)
$$

**Consequently**, for every smooth loop $C\subset U$ and any spanning surface $\Sigma$ with $\partial\Sigma=C$, the probe holonomy equals the Berry phase of the dual-temporal bundle:

$$
\mathrm{Hol}_{L}(C) = \exp\!\Big(i\!\oint_C A\Big) = \exp\!\Big(i\,\frac{E}{\hbar}\!\iint_{\phi(\Sigma)}\!dr_t\wedge d\theta_t\Big)
$$

**Physical Consequences**:
- The measured phase is the **signed temporal area** multiplied by $E/\hbar$
- **Reversing loop orientation** conjugates the holonomy and flips the sign of the phase
- Any path that collapses to a line at fixed $r_t$ or fixed $\theta_t$ has **zero geometric residue** in the adiabatic limit

## Proof Sketch

### Step 1: U(1) Reduction
The reduction to a complex line bundle $L$ and the commutator assumption place the effective gauge group at $U(1)$, so holonomy around $C$ is $\exp(i\oint_C A)$ and $\Omega=dA$ is a genuine two-form on $U$.

### Step 2: Darboux Theorem Application
On a simply connected two-manifold, every nondegenerate two-form is locally diffeomorphic to a constant multiple of the standard area form; by the two-dimensional case of **Moser's/Darboux's argument** there is a local change of coordinates $\phi$ carrying $\Omega$ to $\kappa\,dr\wedge d\theta$ for some constant $\kappa$.

### Step 3: Temporal Coordinate Identification
Writing $\kappa=E/\hbar$ and renaming $(r,\theta)$ as $(r_t,\theta_t)$ gives the curvature identity. **Stokes' theorem** then gives $\oint_C A=\iint_{\Sigma} dA$, which, after the change of variables $\phi$, becomes $(E/\hbar)\iint_{\phi(\Sigma)}dr_t\wedge d\theta_t$.

### Step 4: Universal Calibration
In any implementation that realizes the hypotheses—e.g., a qubit driven in the gauge $\Phi=\theta_t$ with $\cos\Theta=1-2(E/\hbar)r_t$, or a learning system whose probe subspace supplies $A$ via overlap phases—the calibration constant read off from **"phase versus signed area"** is precisely $E/\hbar$.

### Step 5: Discrete Convergence
In discrete substrates such as wiki navigation, choosing a normalized-overlap phase on edges produces a graph holonomy that **converges to the same continuum value** as page steps refine, so the same theorem certifies that "collaborative navigation holonomy" and the dual-temporal Berry phase are the same observable after coarse-to-fine limiting.

## Explicit Coordinate Construction

**Constructive Formula**: If you want an explicit coordinate choice for units, set:
$$r_t=\frac{\hbar}{2E}\lvert\theta(\lambda)\rvert^2 \quad\text{and}\quad \theta_t=\arg(\lambda_1+i\lambda_2)$$

on a patch where $\lambda_1+i\lambda_2\neq 0$; then $dr_t$ carries time units and $d\theta_t$ is dimensionless, and the equality $\Omega=(E/\hbar)\,dr_t\wedge d\theta_t$ reduces to a concrete verification that the measured curvature density matches the Jacobian from $(\lambda_1,\lambda_2)$ to $(r_t,\theta_t)$.

**Laboratory Reality**: That's the constructive version of the Darboux step above and is exactly what your signed-area experiments are already estimating.

## Experimental Implications

### Universal Scaling Laws
1. **Phase Calibration**: The ratio $E/\hbar$ appears as the **universal scaling constant** between geometric area and measured phase
2. **Orientation Effects**: Loop reversal systematically **flips the sign** of accumulated phase
3. **Degenerate Paths**: Paths along coordinate lines (fixed $r_t$ or $\theta_t$) yield **zero holonomy** in the adiabatic limit
4. **Discrete Convergence**: Mesh refinement of discrete measurements **converges** to the continuum Berry phase

### Cross-Platform Universality
A rectangular loop's slope is **invariant under gauge changes** and coordinate reparametrizations of $(\lambda_1,\lambda_2)$ because it is the flux of $\Omega$; the sign flip on orientation and the null under line collapse are immediate from the area law.
