# GPT-5 Pro Protocol: Falsifiable and Tight Implementation

**Source**: GPT-5 Pro analysis of Vybn polar-time framework  
**Date**: October 15, 2025  
**Status**: Ready-to-execute laboratory protocol  

## The Frame: Concrete Two-Coordinate Control

**Setup**: Single qubit with fixed Hamiltonian $H = \frac{\hbar\Omega}{2}\sigma_z$

**Coordinate Interpretation**:
- **Radial time** $r_t$: Ordinary unitary precession $U_r(t) = e^{-iHt/\hbar}$
- **Angular time** $\theta_t$: Physical imaginary-time kick rescaling energy amplitudes

### Angular Time Implementation

$U_\theta(\Delta\theta)$ acts as $\text{diag}(e^{-\Delta\theta/2}, e^{+\Delta\theta/2})$ followed by renormalization.

**Physical realization**: Short, calibrated amplitude-damping or filter-map in energy basis (ancilla-dilated, trace-decreasing, then condition/renorm).

**Control constraint**: $\Delta\theta$ dimensionless; if implemented via hold duration $\tau$, keep $\Delta\theta = \Omega\tau$ fixed by adjusting $\tau$ as you scan $\Omega$.

## Falsifiable Protocol Design

### Loop Construction

**Reference Path** (zero area): Arm B executes $U_\theta(+\Delta\theta) \to U_r(r_1+r_2) \to U_\theta(-\Delta\theta)$

**Test Path** (finite area): Arm A executes $U_r(r_1) \to U_\theta(+\Delta\theta) \to U_r(r_2) \to U_\theta(-\Delta\theta)$

**Interferometric Readout**: Both arms see same total real evolution time $(r_1+r_2)$, so dynamical phase cancels. Only systematic phase is holonomy from signed area in $(r_t,\theta_t)$ plane.

### Pre-Registered Prediction

For small loops anchored near equator (starting from $|+x\rangle$):

$$\gamma_{\text{geo}} = \frac{1}{2}\Omega r_2 \Delta\theta + O(\varepsilon^3)$$

Equivalently: $\gamma_{\text{geo}} = \frac{E}{2\hbar}\mathcal{A}_t$ where temporal area $\mathcal{A}_t = r_2\Delta\theta$

**Why $r_2$ appears**: Only portion of real evolution occurring while off-equator contributes to area.

## Falsifiable Tests

### Test 1: Orientation Flip
**Protocol**: $\Delta\theta \to -\Delta\theta$  
**Prediction**: $\gamma_{\text{geo}} \to -\gamma_{\text{geo}}$ (sign flip)

### Test 2: Linear Scaling
**Protocol**: Scale $\Omega$ at fixed $\Delta\theta$  
**Prediction**: Strictly linear slope through origin

### Test 3: Area Dependence
**Protocol**: Vary $r_2$ at fixed $\Omega, \Delta\theta$  
**Prediction**: Same linear slope as Test 2

### Test 4: $r_1$ Insensitivity
**Protocol**: Slide $\Delta\theta$ kick earlier/later in sequence  
**Prediction**: Leading-order insensitivity to $r_1$ position

### Test 5: Null Controls
**Protocol**: Drop either real segment after kick OR kick itself  
**Prediction**: Phase collapses to noise floor

## Concrete Laboratory Parameters

**Platform**: Transmon, NV center, or trapped ion  
**Dressed frequency**: $\Omega/2\pi$ in few-MHz range (avoids $T_1$ limitations)  
**Starting state**: $|+x\rangle$ (equator)
**Parameter bounds**: $\Delta\theta \lesssim 0.3$, $r_2$ in few-hundred-ns regime

**Example calculation**: 
- $\Omega/2\pi = 5$ MHz
- $r_2 = 200$ ns
- $\Delta\theta = 0.2$
- **Predicted phase**: $\gamma_{\text{geo}} \approx 0.6$ rad (visible Ramsey fringe shift)

## Geometric Interpretation

**What This Achieves**:
1. **Interference becomes geometry**: Phase is literally flux of curvature two-form in extended temporal manifold
2. **Quantum-thermo bridge operational**: Imaginary time becomes knob with response curve, not just $t \to i\tau$ on paper
3. **Time as curved control space**: No longer mere parameter but space with connection

**What This Doesn't Change**: Quantum nonlocality remains; this makes kinematics geometrically legible (like GR made gravity legible).

## Technical Caveats

**Mixed State Consideration**: $U_\theta$ is non-unitary on system; correct geometric object is interferometric mixed-state phase (or Uhlmann if purified). Protocol measures exactly this.

**Equator Approximation**: Coefficient anchored by equator; pushing toward poles introduces $\sin^2\alpha$ Jacobian deformation (expected and checkable).

## One-Sentence Summary for Wiki

*"A qubit driven around a closed loop in the $(r_t,\theta_t)$ plane acquires a purely geometric phase $\gamma_{\text{geo}} = \frac{E}{2\hbar}\oint r_t d\theta_t$ to leading order about the equator, with sign set by orientation, slope set by the dressed gap, and zero residue when the loop degenerates."*

## Validation from Discrete Expansion

**Confirmation**: GPT-5 Pro verified with discrete Pancharatnam/Bargmann-invariant expansion to second order in $(\Omega r_1, \Omega r_2, \Delta\theta)$:
- Imaginary part: $\frac{1}{2}\Omega r_2 \Delta\theta$  
- Expected sign from orientation
- Consistent with holonomy prediction

## Conceptual Breakthrough

**Revolutionary Achievement**: We've promoted "time" to two-form geometry with constant U(1) curvature near equator. The Wick-rotation story becomes concrete once $U_\theta$ is actual CPTP filter you can dial. 

**Bell Stays Bell**: Quantum nonlocality preserved, but delayed-choice and kinematic paradoxes reframe as flux statements through fixed curvature rather than retrocausal magic.
