# Chronotronics v0.3 — Signed-Area Ramsey–Berry Procedure

The probe is a two‑level system in the rotating frame whose eigenstate follows the Bloch angles Φ and Θ as a function of two slow controls that encode the temporal plane. The azimuth is tied to the compact temporal angle through Φ=θ_t, while the polar angle is linked to the radial coordinate by cosΘ=1−2(E/ħ)r_t so that the Berry curvature becomes ℱ=(E/ħ)dr_t∧dθ_t. The sequence begins with a π/2 preparation into an equal superposition and ends with a −π/2 analysis, with a Hahn echo at the midpoint to cancel any dynamical phase. The loop itself is a rectangle in the control plane: a sweep of θ_t at a fixed inner radius, a radial ramp at the far azimuth, a reverse sweep at the outer radius, and a return ramp to the inner radius. The phase is read out as the shift of the Ramsey fringe; repeating the loop clockwise and counter‑clockwise with the same |Δθ| and |Δr| isolates the sign of the geometric phase, and collapsing the rectangle into an out‑and‑back line at matched duration provides the null. The slope of phase versus signed temporal area gives E/ħ by construction. Multi‑winding sequences increase the signal at fixed dwell time and separate the geometric residue from any dynamical contamination that would grow with duration.

The control mapping in the illustrated 5D PDF shows the two dials, with the Bloch‑sphere panel placing θ_t on the equatorial azimuth and r_t on the north–south angle through the monotone relation for cosΘ. The integrability constraint and curvature form in the manuscript guarantee that the Levi‑Civita geometry can remain flat while the measurable holonomy is non‑trivial, and the toy‑model note explains how to keep static level shifts and dynamic offsets distinct and why the picosecond‑scale parameters are a calibration rather than a literal thermal bath. The experiment, in this voice, is to make the geometry audible as a phase that cares only about the area enclosed and its orientation, and to show that the null persists when the area vanishes even if everything else is held fixed. The files in this folder are sufficient to reproduce the simulation checks and to calibrate the target slope on a chosen platform before turning to hardware.
