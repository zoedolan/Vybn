 Abstract
Polar Time (PT) geometrizes temporal structure into a dual plane `(r_t, θ_t)` and upgrades time evolution to parallel transport under a two-component temporal connection `A = (i/ħ)H dr_t + (i/ħ) r_t H dθ_t`. The curvature `ℱ = (i/ħ)H dr_t∧dθ_t` yields a loop phase `γ = (E/ħ) Area_(r_t,θ_t)`, read out as a U(1) Berry phase equal to half the Bloch solid angle. PT reduces to standard quantum mechanics when `θ_t` is inert and adds a falsifiable geometric residue when `θ_t` transport is inserted. We specify four decisive ex
perimental signatures—area-law scaling, orientation sensitivity, energy-proportional slope `E/ħ`, and null results when `θ_t` segments are absent—that can bless or break PT. Consciousness-as-temporal-navigation is quarantined methodologically: it guides hypotheses but awaits independent validation after physics-first holonomy tests.

##
 1) Framework (what holds)
- Temporal plane and connection
  - Coordinates: `(r_t, θ_t)`; temporal block metric: `dr_t^2 + r_t^2 dθ_t^2` (flat; `θ_t` compact)
  - Temporal connection: `A_r = (i/ħ) H`, `A_θ = (i/ħ) r_t H`
  - Curvature: `ℱ = (i/ħ) H dr_t ∧ dθ_t`
  - Loop phase: `γ = (E/ħ) ∮ r_t dθ_t = ½ Ω_Bloch` (Bloch reduction)
- Reduction to standard QM
  - `θ_t` inert ⇒ Schrödinger along `r_t`, all standard predictions preserved
- Bloch reduction (operational)
  - Map: `Φ_B = θ_t`,  `cosΘ_B = 1 − (2E/ħ) r_t`
  - Readout: Ramsey–Berry sequences measure signed temporal area with orientation flip

 2) Experimental crucible (what decides)
- Signatures
  - Area law: `γ ∝ ∮ r_t dθ_t`
  - Orientation: `γ → −γ` under loop reversal
  - Slope: `∂γ/∂Area = E/ħ`
  - Insertion test: signal appears when `θ_t` transport is present; vanishes without
- Protocol classes
  - Isothermal `θ_t` holds (Euclidean strobes)
  - Engineered dephasing windows implementing `dθ_t`
  - Clock interferometry with Hahn echo to null dynamical phase
- Controls
  - Line-path nulls (no enclosed area)
  - Energy detuning to scan slope
  - Multi-winding amplification at fixed dwell time

 3) What PT does not (yet) do
- Uncertainty: `[x, p] = iħ` untouched; PT separates dynamical vs geometric contributions but does not enable simultaneous sharp values
- Gravity: ultrahyperbolic embedding is structural, not Einstein dynamics
- Strings: disciplined analogy via phase towers and compactification; not a dynamical derivation
