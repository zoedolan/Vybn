## Abstract
Polar Time (PT) geometrizes temporal structure into a dual plane (r_t, θ_t) and upgrades time evolution to parallel transport under a two-component temporal connection A = (i/ħ)H dr_t + (i/ħ) r_t H dθ_t. The curvature ℱ = (i/ħ)H dr_t∧dθ_t yields a loop phase γ = (E/ħ) Area_(r_t,θ_t), read out as a U(1) Berry phase equal to half the Bloch solid angle. PT reduces to standard quantum mechanics when θ_t is inert and adds a falsifiable geometric residue when θ_t transport is inserted. We specify four decisive experimental signatures—area-law scaling, orientation sensitivity, energy-proportional slope E/ħ, and null results when θ_t segments are absent—that can bless or break PT. Consciousness-as-temporal-navigation is quarantined methodologically: it guides hypotheses but awaits independent validation after physics-first holonomy tests.

## 1) Framework (what holds)

- Temporal plane and connection
  - Coordinates: (r_t, θ_t); temporal block metric: dr_t^2 + r_t^2 dθ_t^2 (flat; θ_t compact)
  - Temporal connection: A_r = (i/ħ) H, A_θ = (i/ħ) r_t H
  - Curvature: ℱ = (i/ħ) H dr_t ∧ dθ_t
  - Loop phase: γ = (E/ħ) ∮ r_t dθ_t = ½ Ω_Bloch (Bloch reduction)

- Reduction to standard QM
  - θ_t inert ⇒ Schrödinger along r_t, all standard predictions preserved

- Bloch reduction (operational)
  - Map: Φ_B = θ_t,  cosΘ_B = 1 − (2E/ħ) r_t
  - Readout: Ramsey–Berry sequences measure signed temporal area with orientation flip

## 2) Experimental crucible (what decides)

- Signatures
  - Area law: γ ∝ ∮ r_t dθ_t
  - Orientation: γ → −γ under loop reversal
  - Slope: ∂γ/∂Area = E/ħ
  - Insertion test: signal appears when θ_t transport is present; vanishes without

- Protocol classes
  - Isothermal θ_t holds (Euclidean strobes)
  - Engineered dephasing windows implementing dθ_t
  - Clock interferometry with Hahn echo to null dynamical phase

- Controls
  - Line-path nulls (no enclosed area)
  - Energy detuning to scan slope
  - Multi-winding amplification at fixed dwell time

## 3) What PT does not (yet) do

- Uncertainty: [x, p] = iħ untouched; PT separates dynamical vs geometric contributions but does not enable simultaneous sharp values
- Gravity: ultrahyperbolic embedding is structural, not Einstein dynamics
- Strings: disciplined analogy via phase towers and compactification; not a dynamical derivation

---

## 4) Consciousness as temporal navigation (quarantined)

- Hypothesis: distinct conscious modes correspond to navigation patterns on (r_t, θ_t)
  - Attention: radial progression (θ_t constrained)
  - Meditation: angular circulation (r_t stationary)
  - Creativity: helical motion (coupled r_t–θ_t)
- Near-term program: validate PT holonomy in devices first; then seek neural phase-navigation correlates (alpha–theta coupling, orientation-sensitive phase accumulation)
- No ontological claims pending data; avoid overextension

---

## 5) Risk and reward

- If the four signatures fail: PT is a reparameterization; retire it
- If they succeed: θ_t detours become physical rotations; geometric residue becomes a law; delayed-choice puzzles redraw without retrocausality; a new handle on quantum–classical calibration emerges

## Appendix: Generator grammar

From U(t+Δt,t) = 1 − (i/ħ) H Δt + O(Δt^2), Stone’s theorem gives iħ ∂_t U = H U. PT rewrites the same grammar on a richer temporal manifold with a compact angular degree. The novel content is the **measurable holonomy** when θ_t is deliberately engaged.
