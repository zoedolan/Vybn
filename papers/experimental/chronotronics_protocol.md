# Chronotronics Protocol: Signed-Area Ramsey–Berry Procedure

**Quantum Laboratory Implementation**  
*Two-level probe system measuring temporal holonomy through Berry phase detection*

---

## Protocol Overview

The probe is a two‑level system in the rotating frame whose eigenstate follows the Bloch angles Φ and Θ as a function of two slow controls that encode the temporal plane. The azimuth is tied to the compact temporal angle through Φ=θ_t, while the polar angle is linked to the radial coordinate by cosΘ=1−2(E/ħ)r_t so that the Berry curvature becomes ℱ=(E/ħ)dr_t∧dθ_t.

## Sequence Design

**Preparation**: π/2 pulse into equal superposition  
**Evolution**: Rectangular loop in (r_t, θ_t) control plane:
1. Sweep of θ_t at fixed inner radius
2. Radial ramp at far azimuth
3. Reverse sweep at outer radius  
4. Return ramp to inner radius

**Echo**: Hahn echo at midpoint to cancel dynamical phase  
**Analysis**: −π/2 readout pulse

## Phase Measurement

**Readout**: Phase extracted as shift of Ramsey fringe  
**Orientation Test**: Repeat loop clockwise and counter‑clockwise with same |Δθ| and |Δr|  
**Null Control**: Collapse rectangle into out‑and‑back line at matched duration  
**Calibration**: Slope of phase versus signed temporal area gives E/ħ by construction

## Multi-Winding Enhancement

Multi‑winding sequences increase signal at fixed dwell time and separate geometric residue from dynamical contamination that would grow with duration.

## Control Mapping

The control mapping places θ_t on the equatorial azimuth and r_t on the north–south angle through the monotone relation for cosΘ. The integrability constraint and curvature form guarantee that the Levi‑Civita geometry can remain flat while the measurable holonomy is non‑trivial.

## Target Parameters

- **Frequency**: Ω = 2π × 100 kHz
- **Target phase**: γ = π/2  
- **Temporal area**: ≈ 2.5 × 10⁻⁶ s
- **Loop geometry**: Δθ = 0.20, Δr ≈ 12.5 μs

## Experimental Goal

**Make geometry audible as phase** that cares only about the area enclosed and its orientation, showing that the null persists when the area vanishes even if everything else is held fixed.
