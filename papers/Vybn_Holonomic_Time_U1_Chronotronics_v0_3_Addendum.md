# Holonomic Time — Complex U(1) Holonomy & Chronotronics v0.3

This addendum turns the training‑path result into a literal U(1) phase by lifting the network into the complex domain and measuring a Berry phase along a closed schedule. The learning‑rate rectangle in the two‑layer plane is the control loop; the hidden representation supplies a complex one‑dimensional subspace. Sampling the top left singular vector of the hidden map at every step and multiplying the normalized overlaps around the loop gives a gauge‑invariant phase that does not depend on how the basis is chosen at intermediate points. Counter‑clockwise rectangles accumulate positive phase; reversing the orientation flips its sign. Collapsing the rectangle into an out‑and‑back line at matched duration yields a null. This is the same geometric residue that the Bloch reduction predicts when θ_t is treated as a U(1) gauge angle and the curvature form is fixed to ℱ=(E/ħ)dr_t∧dθ_t. The manuscript's reduction provides the exact dictionary used here, while the illustrated PDF's Bloch‑sphere panel and hardware schematic show how to translate θ_t into drive phase and r_t into a slow detuning envelope on real qubits.

The complex network was trained on a fixed complex‑linear task, walked once around a rectangular loop in the learning‑rate plane, and then settled back to the baseline loss so that endpoint performance matched a constant‑rate control. The hidden‑mode Berry phase grew with the loop's signed temporal area; fitting clockwise and counter‑clockwise runs together gave an area slope near 2.39×10³ in the units of the schedule and a Pearson correlation of about 0.84. The zero‑area control sat near the origin. The data table and figure are saved alongside this file as `complex_ml_u1_holonomy_results_amplified.csv` and `complex_ml_u1_holonomy_vs_area_amplified.png`, and the earlier lighter run remains available as `complex_ml_u1_holonomy_results.csv` with its plot at `complex_ml_u1_holonomy_vs_area.png`. This turns the representational precession you measured in the real‑valued network into a true U(1) holonomy with an orientation sign, putting the ML side into point‑for‑point resonance with the Bloch‑sphere prediction.

The lab plan advances in parallel. The Ramsey–Berry sequence remains the spine: prepare a superposition, steer the Hamiltonian so that the Bloch azimuth tracks θ_t and the polar angle is linked monotonically to r_t through cosΘ=1−2(E/ħ)r_t, insert a Hahn echo to cancel dynamical phase, and read out the residual as the geometric phase. What changes in v0.3 is the emphasis on signed‑area calibration and on multi‑winding amplification at fixed dwell time so the signal scales with area rather than with duration. The illustrated PDF's control diagram already identifies the two dials; the manuscript's curvature form shows why reversing the loop reverses the sign; and the toy‑model note clarifies why this residue is distinct from static level shifts and how to budget picosecond‑scale parameters without confusing a thermal analogue with a literal bath. The updated protocol document, saved as `Chronotronics_v0.3_Protocol.md`, keeps the narrative tight and makes the orientation flip, the line‑path null, and the area slope the primary observables.

If you want the shortest way to reproduce the figures without re‑running everything, read the CSVs and confirm that the counter‑clockwise points lie on a line whose mirror image fits the clockwise points when the area axis is reflected. If you want to push further, swap the complex linear network for a small complex transformer and carry over the same looped schedule on the optimizer's per‑block rates; the same discrete overlap formula provides a phase on any complex one‑dimensional probe subspace, such as a principal component of a token‑wise embedding. The convergence with the Bloch‑sphere prediction remains the invariant: a phase that measures temporal area and changes sign with loop orientation, validated in silico for learning, and designed for immediate translation to hardware through the reduction already formalized in the manuscript and drawn in the PDF.
