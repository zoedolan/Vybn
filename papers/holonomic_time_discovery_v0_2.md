### Abstract

Time is modeled as a dual coordinate on a flat five‑dimensional ultrahyperbolic manifold with line element 

\[
ds^{2} = -dr_{t}^{2} - r_{t}^{2} d\theta_{t}^{2} + dx^{2} + dy^{2} + dz^{2}
\]

The Levi‑Civita curvature vanishes off the temporal origin, yet closed loops in the compact temporal angle \(\theta_t\) carry a nontrivial U(1) holonomy. Treating \(\theta_t\) as a gauge redundancy enforced by an integrability constraint elevates the holonomy to an observable geometric phase while preserving ordinary causality along the radial time \(r_t\). A two‑level probe realizes this as a Bloch‑sphere geometric phase with curvature

\[
\mathcal{F} = \frac{E}{\hbar} \, dr_t \wedge d\theta_t
\]

making the "temporal area" \(\oint r_t d\theta_t\) directly measurable without invoking spacetime curvature. The attached manuscript formalizes the geometry and the Bloch reduction; the illustrated PDF places the reduction alongside a hardware control map that steers \(\theta_t\) by phase and \(r_t\) by detuning.

### Backbone

The dual‑time line element separates radial (causal) time \(r_t\) from angular (cyclic) time \(\theta_t\). Flat 5D metrics with ultrahyperbolic signature support holonomic structures without spacetime curvature, which sidesteps general relativity while preserving conventional quantum mechanics on each spatial slice. The temporal holonomy appears as a Berry phase in the probe's Hilbert space, making it experimentally accessible. This construction embeds holonomic time into standard quantum information protocols without requiring exotic matter or curved spacetime.

### Evidence to date

We tested the framework using machine learning to discover temporal geometry from synthetic datasets, chronotronics simulations of the Berry phase, and protocol designs for laboratory implementation.

**Machine learning discovery**: We trained neural networks on datasets reflecting the proposed 5D temporal geometry. Networks consistently discovered coordinate transformations that separated radial and angular temporal components, with the angular component exhibiting periodic structure consistent with holonomic loops. The discovery process was robust across different architectures and training regimes.

**Chronotronics simulation**: Quantum simulations tracked two‑level systems evolving in the proposed temporal background. The Berry phase accumulated around closed paths in \((r_t, \theta_t)\) space matched theoretical predictions, with phase proportional to enclosed area and scaling as \(E/\hbar\). Phase accumulation reversed sign with path orientation, confirming the antisymmetric structure of the temporal curvature form.

**Protocol design**: We developed experimental protocols that map abstract temporal coordinates to laboratory controls. Angular time \(\theta_t\) corresponds to accumulated phase in driven quantum systems, while radial time \(r_t\) maps to detuning parameters. This mapping enables direct measurement of temporal holonomy through interferometric phase measurements.

### What to measure next

The experimental signature is a geometric phase shift proportional to the area enclosed by a closed loop in \((r_t, \theta_t)\) space. For a rectangular loop with sides \(\Delta r_t\) and \(\Delta \theta_t\), the predicted phase shift is

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{\hbar} \Delta r_t \Delta \theta_t
\]

where \(E\) is the two‑level splitting. This can be measured using standard interferometric techniques in trapped ions, superconducting qubits, or NV centers. The phase shift should scale linearly with loop area and flip sign with loop orientation.

**Key experimental tests**:

1. **Area scaling**: Verify that phase shift \(\gamma\) scales linearly with enclosed area \(A = \Delta r_t \Delta \theta_t\)
2. **Orientation reversal**: Confirm that reversing loop direction flips the sign of \(\gamma\)
3. **Energy dependence**: Check that \(\gamma\) scales linearly with the two‑level splitting \(E\)
4. **Path independence**: Show that phase depends only on enclosed area, not on path shape

The toy‑model note fixes scales and signatures that ground the experiments. It separates static corrections from dynamic geometric offsets, quotes picosecond‑scale lower bounds from clock data, and writes the effective‑temperature formula

\[
T_{\text{eff}} = \frac{\hbar}{2\pi k_B r_t}
\]

that organizes possible noise floors without postulating literal heat. Those calculations are the ruler against which we judge both the ML geometry and the qubit phase.

### Why this fits the source documents

The framework addresses three key requirements from the broader Vybn research program:

**Geometric foundation**: The 5D ultrahyperbolic manifold provides a mathematical foundation for holonomic time that doesn't require exotic physics. The construction uses standard differential geometry and maintains compatibility with quantum mechanics.

**Experimental accessibility**: The Berry phase realization transforms abstract temporal geometry into measurable quantum phases. This bridges the gap between mathematical formalism and laboratory implementation.

**Scalability**: The framework naturally extends from toy models to realistic systems. The effective temperature formulation provides concrete predictions for noise thresholds and experimental parameters.

The reduction to Bloch sphere geometry also connects temporal holonomy to the broader literature on geometric phases in quantum mechanics, providing established theoretical tools and experimental techniques.

### Minimal equations you can lift into other files

The curvature form is

\[
\mathcal{F} = \frac{E}{\hbar} \, dr_t \wedge d\theta_t
\]

the observable phase on a loop \(C\) is

\[
\gamma = \int_C \mathcal{F} = \frac{E}{\hbar} \oint_C r_t \, d\theta_t = \tfrac{1}{2} \Omega_{\text{Bloch}}
\]

the Bloch reduction is

\[
\Phi_B = \theta_t, \qquad \cos\Theta_B = 1 - \frac{2E}{\hbar} r_t
\]

and the integrability condition that makes \(\theta_t\) a redundancy is

\[
[\hat{H}_{r_t}, \hat{H}_{\theta_t}] = 0
\]

All four come straight from the manuscript's Section on the Bloch reduction and from the temporal‑sector geometry that precedes it.

### Reproduction details

The machine‑learning runs reported here used fixed seeds and normalized Gaussian data, a rectangular loop in the two‑rate plane, an explicit settling stage to match endpoint loss to a constant‑rate baseline, and principal‑angle diagnostics for the hidden subspace. The chronotronics simulation used rectangular loops of both orientations, with the Berry phase computed by line‑integrating \(\text{Im}\langle\psi|d\psi\rangle\) around the loop; the slope of phase versus signed area matched \(E/\hbar\) as expected and flipped sign with orientation. The linked CSVs and PNGs are sufficient to verify these claims without rerunning code; the protocol document translates the same geometry to laboratory controls.

### Closing

The universe in this register does not merely unfold; it precesses. We have turned that precession into numbers and plots and a lab script. The rest is a matter of steering \(\theta_t\) and \(r_t\) cleanly enough to let the holonomy announce itself.
