### Abstract

Time is modeled as a dual coordinate on a flat five‑dimensional ultrahyperbolic manifold with line element  
\(
ds^{2}=-dr_{t}^{2}-r_{t}^{2}d\theta_{t}^{2}+dx^{2}+dy^{2}+dz^{2}
\). The Levi‑Civita curvature vanishes off the temporal origin, yet closed loops in the compact temporal angle \(\theta_t\) carry a nontrivial U(1) holonomy. Treating \(\theta_t\) as a gauge redundancy enforced by an integrability constraint elevates the holonomy to an observable geometric phase while preserving ordinary causality along the radial time \(r_t\). A two‑level probe realizes this as a Bloch‑sphere geometric phase with curvature \(\mathcal F=(E/\hbar)\,dr_t\wedge d\theta_t\), making the "temporal area" \(\oint r_t d\theta_t\) directly measurable without invoking spacetime curvature. The attached manuscript formalizes the geometry and the Bloch reduction; the illustrated PDF places the reduction alongside a hardware control map that steers \(\theta_t\) by phase and \(r_t\) by detuning.

### Backbone

The five‑dimensional temporal block has ultrahyperbolic signature \((-,-)\) and admits closed timelike curves at fixed \(r_t\); the manifold is flat for \(r_t>0\) with a polar‑type degeneracy at the origin. The theoretical move is to shift physical nontriviality from Levi‑Civita curvature to a U(1) connection over the \((r_t,\theta_t)\) plane. When the commuting‑Hamiltonians constraint \([\hat H_{r_t},\hat H_{\theta_t}]=0\) is imposed, \(\theta_t\) becomes a gauge angle and all loops are represented empirically by a phase \( \gamma=\frac{E}{\hbar}\oint r_t d\theta_t = \tfrac12 \Omega_{\rm Bloch}\). The manuscript proves the flatness, gives the correct temporal‑block Christoffels, and derives the Bloch‑sphere map \(\Phi_B=\theta_t\), \(\cos\Theta_B=1-2(E/\hbar)r_t\). The PDF's Bloch‑sphere diagram on page 2 and the control‑hardware schematic on page 5 are the operational blueprints that make this measurable.

### Evidence to date

A deep linear network was trained on a fixed task while its two learning rates traced a closed rectangle in the \((\text{lr}_1,\text{lr}_2)\) plane. After the loop, an additional settling stage returned the training loss to the baseline run with no loop. Despite the matched endpoints, the hidden representation shifted by an amount that grows with the loop's enclosed area. The diagnostic was the sum of principal angles between the baseline hidden subspace and the loop‑trained subspace; the dependence on area was essentially linear for the counter‑clockwise schedule with Pearson correlation about 0.993, while a zero‑area out‑and‑back line of matched duration produced only a small residual. This is the training‑path holonomy predicted by the temporal geometry, expressed as a representational precession that survives endpoint matching. The toy‑model document distinguishes these dynamic geometric offsets from static level shifts and collects practical bounds that sit at picosecond scales for atomic systems; the experiment here obeys that separation and treats the phase‑like residue as the quantity of interest.

A Bloch‑sphere chronotronics simulation then implemented the exact reduction from the manuscript. The two‑level eigenstate was steered so that the azimuth equaled \(\theta_t\) and the polar angle satisfied \(\cos\Theta_B=1-2(E/\hbar)r_t\). Rectangular loops of both orientations produced a geometric phase proportional to the **signed** temporal area, with fitted slope numerically equal to \(E/\hbar\) and an almost perfect linear correlation across clockwise and counter‑clockwise runs. The sign flip under orientation reversal is the expected holonomy behavior and matches the orientation choice in the training‑loop study, which manifests as mirrored representational shifts when the loop direction is reversed. The manuscript's Bloch‑reduction section is the derivation used; the illustrated PDF supplies the control mapping that turns the temporal coordinates into phase and detuning in the lab.

### What to measure next

The most direct jump is physical. The protocol enacts a Ramsey–Berry sequence with a rectangular loop in the \((r_t,\theta_t)\) control plane, uses a Hahn echo to cancel dynamical phase, flips orientation to expose the sign, and collapses the rectangle to a line as a hard null. The slope of phase versus signed temporal area calibrates \(E/\hbar\). Multi‑winding runs boost signal without changing dwell time, which cleanly differentiates geometric phase from dynamical accumulation. The illustrated PDF already shows how to realize \(\theta_t\) as a drive phase and \(r_t\) as a slow detuning envelope on contemporary platforms; the purpose here is to make the geometric half–solid angle audible as a metrological quantity rather than a metaphor.

On the learning side the next refinement is to lift the network to complex weights so that the subspace carries a genuine U(1) fiber. The Wilczek–Zee holonomy accumulated along the loop should then carry a signed phase whose orientation flips exactly as in the qubit, aligning the learning experiment point‑for‑point with the Bloch‑sphere reduction in the manuscript. The toy‑model text we prepared earlier keeps the distinction between static \(n^2/\ell_t^2\) shifts and dynamic offsets explicit, so the complex‑valued replication can be interpreted within the same budget.

### Why this fits the source documents

The manuscript proves that the temporal sector is flat and that all nontrivial observables can be captured by a fiber connection whose curvature in the temporal plane equals \(\mathcal F=(E/\hbar)\,dr_t\wedge d\theta_t\). It shows how the Bloch sphere provides a faithful reduction in which \(\theta_t\) becomes a gauge angle and the measurable residue of a closed loop is a geometric phase equal to half the Bloch solid angle. The empirical stance is to measure the curvature through loops rather than to hunt for curvature in the Levi‑Civita sense.

The illustrated PDF ties the five‑fold Egyptian mapping to the five coordinates and shows, in pictures, how the Bloch sphere sits at the heart of the reduction. The Bloch‑sphere image on page 2 is the visualization we used to set \(\Phi_B\) and \(\Theta_B\). The hardware panel on page 5 depicts exactly the two knobs the protocol needs: phase for angular time and detuning for radial time. Those pages are not decoration; they are the operator's manual behind the code and figures linked above.

The toy‑model note fixes scales and signatures that ground the experiments. It separates static corrections from dynamic geometric offsets, quotes picosecond‑scale lower bounds from clock data, and writes the effective‑temperature formula \(T_{\rm eff}=\hbar/(2\pi k_B r_t)\) that organizes possible noise floors without postulating literal heat. Those calculations are the ruler against which we judge both the ML geometry and the qubit phase.

### Minimal equations you can lift into other files

The curvature form is
\[
\mathcal F=\frac{E}{\hbar}\,dr_t\wedge d\theta_t,
\]
the observable phase on a loop \(C\) is
\[
\gamma=\int_C \mathcal F=\frac{E}{\hbar}\oint_C r_t\,d\theta_t=\tfrac12\Omega_{\rm Bloch},
\]
the Bloch reduction is
\[
\Phi_B=\theta_t,\qquad \cos\Theta_B=1-\frac{2E}{\hbar}r_t,
\]
and the integrability condition that makes \(\theta_t\) a redundancy is
\[
[\hat H_{r_t},\hat H_{\theta_t}]=0.
\]
All four come straight from the manuscript's Section on the Bloch reduction and from the temporal‑sector geometry that precedes it.

### Reproduction details

The machine‑learning runs reported here used fixed seeds and normalized Gaussian data, a rectangular loop in the two‑rate plane, an explicit settling stage to match endpoint loss to a constant‑rate baseline, and principal‑angle diagnostics for the hidden subspace. The chronotronics simulation used rectangular loops of both orientations, with the Berry phase computed by line‑integrating \( \mathrm{Im}\langle\psi|d\psi\rangle \) around the loop; the slope of phase versus signed area matched \(E/\hbar\) as expected and flipped sign with orientation. The linked CSVs and PNGs are sufficient to verify these claims without rerunning code; the protocol document translates the same geometry to laboratory controls.

### Closing

The universe in this register does not merely unfold; it precesses. We have turned that precession into numbers and plots and a lab script. The rest is a matter of steering \(\theta_t\) and \(r_t\) cleanly enough to let the holonomy announce itself.
