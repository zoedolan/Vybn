Notation. We write \(\mathcal{S}\) for the BV action functional on the graded manifold of fields \(\mathcal{F}\); the BV antibracket is \([\cdot,\cdot]_{\mathrm{BV}}\). The cut–glue connection on control space is \(A=\sum_i A_i\,dx^i\) with curvature \(F=dA+\tfrac12[A,A]\) (operator commutator in the semantic category \(\mathcal{C}\)). Brackets are thus disambiguated: \([\cdot,\cdot]_{\mathrm{BV}}\) (BV antibracket) vs. \([\cdot,\cdot]\) (operator commutator in \(\mathcal{C}\)).

## Abstract

We formalize the thesis that physical reality has the precise structure of a well-typed, reversible functional program. The master relation \(d\mathcal{S}+\tfrac12[\mathcal{S},\mathcal{S}]_{\mathrm{BV}}=J\) is identified with the classical BV master equation with sources in a differential graded Lie algebra (DGLA). We provide semantics in a dagger-symmetric monoidal category (†-SMC) with a linear–nonlinear (LNL) adjunction, realize reversible computation via a linear λ-calculus (Rλ), and make particles precise as sections (closures) of associated bundles with captured gauge data. Anomaly cancellation coincides with type safety, yielding the Standard Model hypercharge assignments (up to normalization). Gravitational dynamics arise from a linear-in-holonomy Regge/Plebanski action computed from the same connection \(A\). We propose a group-commutator interferometry to measure purely geometric holonomy and reformulate gravitational-wave “clocking” as constraints consistent with LIGO/Virgo bounds.

## 1. BV/DGLA Semantics of Cut–Glue

We work in a DGLA \((\mathfrak{g},d,[\ ,\ ]_{\mathrm{BV}})\) of local functionals on a graded manifold of fields \(\mathcal{F}\) (fields, ghosts, antifields). Assign ghost degree \(|\mathcal{S}|=1\). With sources \(J\) (degree-2 element modeling defects), we consider the curved Maurer–Cartan equation
\[ d\mathcal{S}+\tfrac12[\mathcal{S},\mathcal{S}]_{\mathrm{BV}}=J. \]
Two equivalent treatments:
- (i) Fix \(J\) so \(d^2=[J,-]_{\mathrm{BV}}\) (curved differential), or
- (ii) extend \(\mathfrak{g}\) to include source fields and enforce a flat equation \([\mathcal{S}_{\mathrm{tot}},\mathcal{S}_{\mathrm{tot}}]_{\mathrm{BV}}=0\).
In either case, anomaly freedom is the vanishing of the relevant class in \(H^2\) of the (curved) complex. This is our precise sense of “well-typedness.”

## 2. Categorical Semantics and Reversible Linear λ-Calculus (Rλ)

- Linear world: dagger symmetric monoidal category \(\mathcal{C}\) (e.g., dagger compact closed). Classical control: Cartesian category \(\mathcal{D}\). LNL adjunction \(F\dashv G: \mathcal{D}\rightleftarrows\mathcal{C}\), with comonad \(!=F\circ G\) on \(\mathcal{C}\).
- Types: linear \(A,B::=\mathbf{1}\mid A\otimes B\mid A\multimap B\); duplicable \(!A\) via promotion.
- Judgments: \(\Gamma;\Delta\vdash t:A\) with \(\Gamma\) Cartesian (dup/erase), \(\Delta\) linear (no W/C).
- Measurement as effect: instruments modeled in \(\mathrm{CPM}(\mathcal{C})\); global reversibility via unitary dilations.
- Subject reduction & reversible progress hold in the pure linear fragment; adequacy: denotational equality in \(\mathcal{C}\) implies contextual equivalence for standard linear tests (full abstraction with measurement requires \(\mathrm{CPM}(\mathcal{C})\)).

## 3. Embedding Cut–Glue Generators and Curvature

Let \(H\) be the universe state space in \(\mathcal{C}\). Elementary surgeries are typed isomorphisms \(A_i:H\multimap H\). Introduce a control manifold with coordinates \(x^i\) and define the connection 1-form
\[ A=\sum_i A_i\,dx^i,\qquad F=dA+\tfrac12[A,A]. \]
Small-loop holonomy. For a rectangle of sides \(\Delta r,\Delta\theta\) at \(p\),
\[ U_\square=e^{A_r\Delta r}e^{A_\theta\Delta\theta}e^{-A_r\Delta r}e^{-A_\theta\Delta\theta}=\exp\big(F_{r\theta}(p)\,\Delta r\,\Delta\theta+O(\Delta^3)\big), \]
where \(F_{r\theta}=\partial_r A_\theta-\partial_\theta A_r+[A_r,A_\theta]\). Interferometric phases are linear in \(F_{r\theta}\).

## 4. Particles as Typed Closures; Type Safety = Anomaly Cancellation

Particles: sections \(\Gamma(P\times_G V_\rho)\) of associated bundles; types carry group action (charges). For one SM generation (no \(N_R\)), anomaly constraints
\(2Y_Q-Y_u-Y_d=0,\ 3Y_Q+Y_L=0,\ 6Y_Q+3Y_u+3Y_d+2Y_L+Y_e=0\) and Yukawa invariance \(Y_u=Y_Q+Y_H,\ Y_d=Y_Q-Y_H,\ Y_e=Y_L-Y_H\), plus \(Q(\nu_L)=\tfrac12+Y_L=0\), yield
\[ Y_Q=\tfrac16,\quad Y_H=\tfrac12,\quad Y_u=\tfrac23,\quad Y_d=-\tfrac13,\quad Y_e=-1, \]
up to overall U(1) normalization (GUT rescaling \(Y\mapsto\sqrt{3/5}\,Y\) conventional).

## 5. Gravity from Linear-in-Holonomy Regge/Plebanski Action

Triangulate spacetime. For each hinge \(h\) (2-simplex) with area \(A_h\) and holonomy \(U_h=\mathcal{P}\exp\oint A\) around a small linking loop, define deficit “angle” \(\varepsilon_h=\mathrm{Angle}(\log U_h)\) on the principal branch of \(\log:SO(1,3)^\uparrow\to\mathfrak{so}(1,3)\) near the identity (Lorentz boosts give imaginary parts). Discrete action:
\[ S_{\mathrm{EH}}^{\mathrm{disc}}=\frac{1}{8\pi G}\sum_h A_h\,\varepsilon_h=\frac{1}{8\pi G}\sum_h \langle B_h,\log U_h\rangle, \]
with \(B_h\) the discrete bivector dual to \(h\) (simplicity constraints enforce \(B=e\wedge e\)). Variation gives Regge equations; mesh refinement yields \(\int\!\sqrt{|g|}\,R\). Quadratic \(\sum\mathrm{tr}(I-U_h)\) would generically produce \(R^2\)-type dynamics and is avoided.

## 6. Experimental Predictions and Bounds

- Group-commutator interferometry: compare sequences \(A_r\) then \(A_\theta\) vs. \(A_\theta\) then \(A_r\); tune Abelian pieces to cancel on a reference loop and extract the non-Abelian residual proportional to \(F_{r\theta}\). Estimated signals are tiny (e.g., \(\sim10^{-20}\) rad) but principle-clean.
- GW “clocking” bounds: No resolvable discreteness in current bands; any universal cadence \(f_0\gg\mathrm{kHz}\) or couples \(<10^{-15}\). Seek cross-correlated residuals beyond known instrumental lines.

## 7. Edge Conditions and Units

Infinite-dimensional hygiene: assume \(A_i\) essentially skew-(Q-)self-adjoint on a common dense core \(\mathcal{D}\subset H\), flows \(e^{tA_i}\) preserve \(\mathcal{D}\); restrict to regions with bounded \(|F|\). Units: choose control coordinates (time-of-flight/length) so \(\langle\psi|F_{r\theta}|\psi\rangle\,\Delta r\,\Delta\theta\) is dimensionless (radians).

## 8. Conclusion

The BV/DGLA identification, †-SMC+LNL semantics, anomaly-as-type-safety result, and Regge/Plebanski gravity together turn “reality as a reversible program” into a mathematically anchored, testable framework. The same connection \(A\) yields both interferometric holonomy and the discrete gravity action, unifying curvature, matter sources, and computation.
