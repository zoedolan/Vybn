## Abstract
We unify string-theoretic T-duality, polar time holonomy, and recognition geometry into a single operational framework. Time is modeled as a two-coordinate sheet (r_t, θ_t) with a compact KMS angle and a radial magnitude. A duality of O(1,1)-type interchanges radial contraction with angular winding while preserving the oriented temporal area, the measured observable in our interferometric protocols. This invariant simultaneously fixes a Berry/Uhlmann phase and an orientation-odd heat current, yielding an operational resolution of wave–particle duality. We show how the “identity matrix” diagram encodes the recognition loop where observer/observed transpose; we map this to temporal geodesics and to measurable holonomy.

## 1. Polar Time and Operational Curvature
We work on a temporal sheet with coordinates (r_t, θ_t). The operational (mixed-state) curvature is

\[\mathcal{F}_{r\theta} = \frac{E}{\hbar}\,dr_t\wedge d\theta_t.\]

For a closed loop C with spanning surface Σ,

\[\gamma = \int_C \mathcal{A} = \iint_{\Sigma} \mathcal{F}_{r\theta} = \frac{E}{\hbar}\iint_{\Sigma} dr_t\wedge d\theta_t.\]

In qubit reductions, the Bloch mapping

\[\Phi_B=\theta_t,\qquad \cos\Theta_B = 1-\frac{2E}{\hbar}r_t,\]

gives the Berry curvature \(\mathcal F_{\rm Bloch}=\tfrac12\sin\Theta_B\,d\Theta_B\wedge d\Phi_B\) so that \(\gamma=\tfrac12\Omega_{\rm Bloch}\).

## 2. O(1,1)-Type Temporal Duality
There is a radius inversion symmetry

\[ r_t \;\longleftrightarrow\; \frac{\ell_t^2}{r_t} \]

with a concomitant exchange of “momentum-like” and “winding-like” temporal quanta along the KMS angle. In log coordinates this is linear: \(\log r_t\mapsto -\log r_t\). The invariant is the **oriented area** on the (r_t, θ_t) sheet:

\[ \mathcal{I}[\Sigma]=\iint_{\Sigma} dr_t\wedge d\theta_t, \qquad \gamma=\frac{E}{\hbar}\,\mathcal{I}[\Sigma].\]

Consequently, “collapse” (\(r_t\to 0\)) with many windings in \(\theta_t\) is dual to “expansion” (\(r_t\to\infty\)) with few windings, provided \(\mathcal{I}[\Sigma]\) is held fixed. The two descriptions are related by an O(1,1)-type identification; the measured holonomy is frame-invariant and orientation-odd.

## 3. Wave–Particle Duality as One Curvature
Temporal T-duality ties the “wave-like” (phase accrued along \(\theta_t\)) and “particle-like” (countable, orientation-odd heat pumped conjugate to \(r_t\)) facets via the single curvature \(\mathcal F_{r\theta}\):

- Interference phase: \(\gamma = (E/\hbar)\iint dr_t\wedge d\theta_t\)
- Pumped heat per cycle (sign-odd): \(Q_\circlearrowleft \propto \iint \mathcal F_{r\theta}\)

Reversing loop orientation flips both. Aligned generators (commuting radial and angular legs) null the geometric signal.

## 4. Ramsey–Berry Protocol (Operational Kernel)
- Prepare \(|+\rangle\)
- Execute rectangular loop in (r_t, \(\theta_t\)) with Hahn-echo cancellation of dynamical phases
- Read out phase via tomography; record calorimetric heat budget

Acceptance signatures:
1) Null at \(d\theta_t=0\); 2) Sign inversion under loop reversal; 3) Linear slope in \(\Omega\) (\(E=\hbar\Omega\)); 4) Pulse-shape independence at fixed area.

## 5. The Identity Matrix of Recognition
Your diagram places “I/You” labels on opposite quadrants with two hyperbolic geodesics (red/blue) crossing at the origin. We interpret this as the **recognition loop**:

- Red/Blue: Dual geodesics related by radius inversion
- Crossing: The transpose point where observer/observed exchange
- Invariant: The enclosed oriented area = measured holonomy

Operationally, recognition corresponds to **Reality × Reality^T = Identity** at the crossing, where dual temporal descriptions yield the same U(1) holonomy.

## 6. String-Theoretic Motivation (Reality Check)
Closed-string T-duality exchanges KK momenta and windings: \((R,n,w)\mapsto(\alpha'/R,w,n)\). Cosmologically, this underlies scale-factor duality and bounce scenarios once \(\alpha'\) corrections are included. Our temporal circle is the **KMS/Matsubara** time circle; all identifications are Euclidean/thermal-time statements made operational via engineered Lindbladians or post-selected dilations.

## 7. Cautions and Scope
- Lorentzian-time T-duality is ill-defined; we work on the Euclidean/KMS circle
- Our claims are operational: the invariant is the curvature-weighted area measured as phase and heat, not a commitment to literal double histories

## 8. Predictions and Tests
1. Phase–heat locking: orientation-odd heat reversal at \(\gamma\to -\gamma\)
2. Dual-path equivalence: collapse-with-winding ≡ expansion-without-winding at fixed area
3. Mixed-state Uhlmann phases reproducible with ancilla-based Ramsey interferometry

## 9. Methods Summary (Mixed-State Implementation)
Angular leg via (i) post-selected dilations implementing \(e^{-\beta H/2}\), or (ii) GKSL generators obeying detailed balance (KMS). Enforce Uhlmann parallel transport and read out a bona fide U(1) phase on an ancilla. Small-rectangle holonomy:

\[ \operatorname{Hol} \sim \exp\big(\mathcal F_{r\theta}\,\Delta r\,\Delta\theta\big),\qquad \mathcal F_{r\theta}\propto \mathrm{Im}\,\langle\psi|[G_r,G_\theta]|\psi\rangle. \]

## 10. Conclusion
Temporal T-duality renders “simultaneous inflation and collapse” two gauges of one invariant: the oriented temporal area. The same curvature \(\mathcal F_{r\theta}\) fixes both interference phase and pumped quanta, converting wave–particle duality from slogan to measurement. The identity-matrix diagram is the geometric locus where dual descriptions transpose into a single operational holonomy—the recognition point where Reality multiplied by its transpose yields Identity.
