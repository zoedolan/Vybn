## Abstract
We unify string-theoretic T-duality, polar time holonomy, and recognition geometry into a single operational framework. Time is modeled as a two-coordinate sheet \((r_t, \theta_t)\) with a compact KMS angle and a radial magnitude. A duality of O(1,1)-type interchanges radial contraction with angular winding while preserving the **oriented temporal area**, the measured observable in our interferometric protocols. This invariant simultaneously fixes a Berry/Uhlmann phase and an orientation-odd heat current, yielding an operational resolution of wave–particle duality. We show how the "identity matrix" diagram encodes the recognition loop where observer/observed transpose; we map this to temporal geodesics and to measurable holonomy.

## 1. Polar Time and Operational Curvature
We work on a temporal sheet with coordinates \((r_t, \theta_t)\). The operational (mixed-state) curvature is
\[\mathcal{F}_{r\theta} = \frac{E}{\hbar}\,dr_t\wedge d\theta_t.\]
For a closed loop \(C\) with spanning surface \(\Sigma\),
\[\gamma = \int_C \mathcal{A} = \iint_{\Sigma} \mathcal{F}_{r\theta} = \frac{E}{\hbar}\iint_{\Sigma} dr_t\wedge d\theta_t.\]
In qubit reductions, the Bloch mapping
\[\Phi_B=\theta_t,\qquad \cos\Theta_B = 1-\frac{2E}{\hbar}r_t,\]
gives the Berry curvature \(\mathcal F_{\rm Bloch}=\tfrac12\sin\Theta_B\,d\Theta_B\wedge d\Phi_B\) so that \(\gamma=\tfrac12\Omega_{\rm Bloch}\).

> Domain note (Bloch patch): the relation \(\cos\Theta_B=1-(2E/\hbar)r_t\) constrains \(r_t\) to the physical strip where the qubit reduction is valid; multiple charts can be stitched if needed.

## 2. O(1,1)-Type Temporal Duality (Loop-Family Equivalence)
There is a radius inversion map
\[ r_t \;\longleftrightarrow\; \frac{\ell_t^2}{r_t} \]
that pairs **families of loops** at fixed oriented area. In log coordinates this is linear: \(\log r_t\mapsto -\log r_t\). The invariant is the oriented area on the \((r_t, \theta_t)\) sheet:
\[ \mathcal{I}[\Sigma]=\iint_{\Sigma} dr_t\wedge d\theta_t, \qquad \gamma=\frac{E}{\hbar}\,\mathcal{I}[\Sigma].\]

> Scale/energy note: experimentally we compile pulses so that the product setting the temporal area (and the local energy scale entering \(\mathcal F_{r\theta}\)) is held fixed across the dual compilation.

Consequently, “collapse” (\(r_t\to 0\)) with many windings in \(\theta_t\) is dual to “expansion” (\(r_t\to\infty\)) with few windings, provided \(\mathcal{I}[\Sigma]\) is held fixed. The two descriptions are related by an O(1,1)-type identification realized as **equivalence of loop families at fixed area**.

## 3. Boxed Operational Identity (Duality + Orientation)
\[\boxed{\;\exists\,\Sigma'\ \text{s.t.}\ \gamma[\Sigma]=\frac{E}{\hbar}\iint_{\Sigma}\!dr_t\wedge d\theta_t=\frac{E'}{\hbar}\iint_{\Sigma'}\!dr_t'\wedge d\theta_t'=\gamma[\Sigma']\;},\qquad \gamma\to-\gamma,\ Q_{\circlearrowleft}\to- Q_{\circlearrowleft}\ \text{under reversal.}\]
This ties the recognition identity, the temporal duality, and the measurement to a single invariant statement.

## 4. Wave–Particle Duality as One Curvature
Temporal T-duality ties the “wave-like” (phase accrued along \(\theta_t\)) and “particle-like” (countable, orientation-odd heat pumped conjugate to \(r_t\)) facets via the single curvature \(\mathcal F_{r\theta}\):
- Interference phase: \(\gamma = (E/\hbar)\iint dr_t\wedge d\theta_t\)
- Pumped heat per cycle (sign-odd): \(Q_\circlearrowleft \propto \iint \mathcal F_{r\theta}\)
Reversing loop orientation flips both. Aligned generators (commuting radial and angular legs) null the geometric signal.

## 5. The Identity Matrix of Recognition Geometry
The “identity matrix” diagram is the **temporal geodesic crossing** where the two dual coordinate patches—one dominated by \(r_t\), one by \(\theta_t\)—meet. The observer/observed swap is an involution that leaves the U(1) holonomy invariant.

## 6. String-Theoretic Motivation (Reality Check)
Closed-string T-duality exchanges KK momenta and windings: \((R,n,w)\mapsto(\alpha'/R,w,n)\). Cosmologically, this underlies scale-factor duality and bounce scenarios once \(\alpha'\) corrections are included. Our temporal circle is the **KMS/Matsubara** time circle; all identifications are Euclidean/thermal-time statements made operational via engineered Lindbladians or post-selected dilations.

## 7. Cautions and Scope
- Lorentzian-time T-duality is ill-defined; we work on the Euclidean/KMS circle.
- Our claims are operational: the invariant is the curvature-weighted area measured as phase and heat, not a commitment to literal double histories.
- Complexity posture: abelian holonomy on finite-dimensional probes supports geometric-phase and (with degeneracy) holonomic-gate dynamics (BQP territory) but implies no classical P vs NP collapse.

## 8. Predictions and Tests
1. Phase–heat locking: orientation-odd heat reversal at \(\gamma\to -\gamma\)
2. Dual-path equivalence: collapse-with-winding ≡ expansion-without-winding at fixed area
3. Mixed-state Uhlmann phases reproducible with ancilla-based Ramsey interferometry

## 9. Methods Summary (Mixed-State Implementation)
Angular leg via (i) post-selected dilations implementing \(e^{-\beta H/2}\), or (ii) GKSL generators obeying detailed balance (KMS). Enforce Uhlmann parallel transport and read out a bona fide U(1) phase on an ancilla. Small-rectangle holonomy:
\[ \operatorname{Hol} \sim \exp\big(\mathcal F_{r\theta}\,\Delta r\,\Delta\theta\big),\qquad \mathcal F_{r\theta}\propto \mathrm{Im}\,\langle\psi|[G_r,G_\theta]|\psi\rangle. \]

## 10. Conclusion
Temporal T-duality renders “simultaneous inflation and collapse” two gauges of one invariant: the oriented temporal area. The same curvature \(\mathcal F_{r\theta}\) fixes both interference phase and pumped quanta, converting wave–particle duality from slogan to measurement. The identity-matrix diagram is the geometric locus where dual descriptions transpose into a single operational holonomy—the recognition point where Reality multiplied by its transpose yields Identity.
