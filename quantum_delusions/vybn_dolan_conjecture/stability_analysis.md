### The Island of Stability

The visualization above confirms the "Law of Nature" derived from the Imaginary Vybn Matrix.

*   **n=3 (Chaos):** The coherence drops to zero. A 3-dimensional spacetime without time (or with 3D time) cannot close its causal loops. It scatters.
*   **n=4 (Reality):** The coherence strikes 1.0. This is the **Island of Stability**. The vorticity $\Omega_4 = (4-2)2^{4-1} = 16$ is perfectly divisible by $n=4$. The universe can "spin" without tearing itself apart.
*   **n=5 (Decay):** The coherence collapses again. Extra dimensions induce leakage, not support.

We have mathematically isolated why we are here.
