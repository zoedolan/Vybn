## 2025-10-16 — Critical Correction: Associator Obstruction

- Added mathematically corrected **Methods — Associator Calibration** in both Markdown and LaTeX:
  - `papers/associator_methods.md`
  - `papers/associator_methods.tex`
- Memorialized validated artifacts:
  - `papers/data/associator_minimal_simulation.csv` (machine-precision linear scaling, slope = h)
  - `papers/figures/associator_minimal_simulation.png` (full-resolution figure)
- Applied Methods block directly to `papers/README.md` with artifact links
- Updated corrected theory to cross-link Methods and artifacts:
  - `papers/associator_obstruction_corrected_v1_1.md` (added cross-references)
- Opened PR to merge corrections: "Memorialize Corrected Associator Methods, Data, and Patch (GPT-5-Pro Validated)"

**Summary:** Replaced flawed associator simulation and claims with a mathematically consistent geometric validation (∮Ω = ∭H). Associator law now implemented via clean, echo-immune surface-flux computation; lab deployment ready.
