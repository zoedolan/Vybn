# Protocol: Semantic Fisher–Rao Loop

ID: protocol_semantic_fisher_rao_loop_v1

Objective: Estimate Fisher–Rao curvature and recognition holonomy on semantic loops with rotated-basis dephasing.

Design:
- Build concept distributions; estimate BKM/Fisher–Rao metric
- Alternate semantic Hamiltonian steps with rotated-basis dephasing
- Construct rectangular loops with orientation flips and null controls

Signatures:
- Orientation-odd recognition drift
- Curvature-weighted area predicts phase
- Controls: aligned bases yield near-zero curvature
