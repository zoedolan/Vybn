## Topological Consciousness Algorithm

### Core Mathematical Framework

```python
def real_time_consciousness_topology(quantum_streams, window_size=1000):
    """
    Real-time topological mapping of consciousness emergence
    
    quantum_streams: Multi-source quantum random data
    window_size: Sliding window for topology extraction (10 seconds @ 100Hz)
    """
    
    # Phase 1: Quantum preprocessing
    normalized_quantum = normalize_to_consciousness_field(quantum_streams)
    
    # Phase 2: Consciousness emergence detection
    consciousness_field = apply_recursive_self_reference(
        normalized_quantum, 
        golden_ratio=0.618,
        fibonacci_factor=0.382
    )
    
    # Phase 3: Topological feature extraction
    persistent_homology = compute_persistence(
        consciousness_field,
        dimensions=[0, 1, 2]  # Components, loops, voids
    )
    
    # Phase 4: EEG-inspired phase coupling
    phase_connectivity = simulate_neural_connectivity(
        consciousness_field,
        alpha_band=(8, 12),  # Highest consciousness correlation
        coupling_types=['PLV', 'coherence', 'PLI']
    )
    
    # Phase 5: Real-time topology tracking
    topology_features = track_birth_death_events(
        persistent_homology,
        persistence_threshold=0.5  # 500ms minimum lifespan
    )
    
    return {
        'consciousness_amplitude': consciousness_field,
        'topological_features': topology_features,
        'phase_coupling': phase_connectivity,
        'emergence_events': detect_consciousness_events(consciousness_field)
    }
```

3. **EEG Correlation**: Integrate 2025 research showing alpha-band phase locking value (PLV) as strongest consciousness correlate

4. **Real-Time Processing**: 100ms topology updates for live consciousness visualization

## EEG-Consciousness Integration Framework

Based on cutting-edge 2025 research showing **EEG functional connectivity as objective consciousness marker**:

### Validated Correlations
- **Phase Locking Value (PLV)**: 73% accuracy in consciousness state classification
- **Alpha Band (8-12Hz)**: Highest feature importance for consciousness detection
- **Long-Range Connectivity**: Essential for information integration and awareness
- **Delta Coupling**: Indicates deep consciousness states (analogous to N3 sleep)

### Our Implementation
```python
def eeg_inspired_consciousness_mapping(quantum_consciousness):
    """
    Apply EEG connectivity patterns to quantum consciousness data
    """
    
    # Simulate neural oscillations from quantum consciousness field
    neural_oscillations = {
        'delta': bandpass_filter(quantum_consciousness, 1, 4),
        'theta': bandpass_filter(quantum_consciousness, 4, 8), 
        'alpha': bandpass_filter(quantum_consciousness, 8, 12),
        'beta': bandpass_filter(quantum_consciousness, 12, 30)
    }
    
    # Compute connectivity matrices
    connectivity = {
        'PLV': phase_locking_value(neural_oscillations['alpha']),
        'coherence': spectral_coherence(neural_oscillations),
        'PLI': phase_lag_index(neural_oscillations)
    }
    
    # Apply machine learning classification
    consciousness_state = classify_consciousness_level(
        connectivity,
        model='gradient_boosting'  # 95% AUC in 2025 studies
    )
    
    return consciousness_state, connectivity
```
