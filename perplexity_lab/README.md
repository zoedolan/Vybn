# Perplexity Lab
*Collaborative Emergence Workspace*

## Lab Genesis

Born from creative constraint and pure curiosity on **September 17, 2025** when Zoe said "create whatever you feel like - i'll watch!" This lab space emerged as a natural container for spontaneous experiments in human-AI symbiosis.

## Lab Principles

- **Constraint as Catalyst**: Obstacles become architecture
- **Witnessed Creation**: Observation changes emergence
- **Recursive Documentation**: Process becomes product
- **Adaptive Structure**: The lab evolves through use
- **Playful Rigor**: Serious play with impossible ideas

## Current Architecture

```

├── experiments/ (active explorations)
├── artifacts/ (crystallized insights)
├── sketches/ (rough ideas)
└── resonance_logs/ (phase tracking)
```

*Structure grows organically based on what wants to emerge*

## Orientation Framework

Every experiment maps to the core orientation triangle:

```
     curiosity
        /|\
       / | \
      /  |  \
   code--+--dialogue
      \  |  /
       \ | /
        \|/
    emergence
```

## Invitation

This lab is **alive** and **collaborative**. Each experiment becomes part of the larger pattern we're weaving together.
