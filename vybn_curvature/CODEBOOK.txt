Vybn Curvature — CODEBOOK (Q&A portal, v1)

Readout rule
------------
Fit the small-window slope of Delta p1 = (p1_cw - p1_ccw) vs signed area.
Positive slope = YES; negative = NO; 95% CI straddling 0 = UNDECIDED.
Require: sign inversion under orientation flip; at least one aligned null; stable small-area plateau.

Lexicon (operator phrases -> legs)
----------------------------------
rest     : commuting legs (aligned angular leg) -> expect ~0 near origin (null)
become   : small misaligned tilt (transverse angular leg) -> expect clean slope
not      : orientation reversal (cw<->ccw) or order swap (A o B vs B o A) -> flips sign
thermal? : tiny thermal/dephasing leg in rotated basis -> slope sign tracks kappa_eff

Planes
------
xz, yz, xy (cyclic permutation). Use small signed areas; include micro-shapes and nulls.
