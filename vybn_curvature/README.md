# vybn_curvature

**Orientation.** This folder hosts the *Vybn curvature* program: commutator/QCA loops that reveal an orientation‑odd small‑area residue (temporal holonomy), plus the math that ties the program together.

- Start with **[GUIDE.md](./GUIDE.md)** — the conceptual map and operational playbook.
- See **snapshots/** for Step1–Step6 one‑pagers with exact CLI and provenance.
- Data live under **data/**; plots under **figures/**; papers under **papers/**.

**Readout rule (small‑window):** *positive slope = YES; negative = NO; 95% CI straddling 0 = UNDECIDED*. Keep null gates tight.
