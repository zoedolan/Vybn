# Quarantine Protocols

This directory contains the extracted Python kernels from the repository's markdown files. 
The purpose is to isolate the executable logic from the narrative "slop" to determine if any physical validity remains.

## Extracted Kernels (Pending)
- `vybn_plg_kernel.py` (from geo_phase_engineering.md)
- `vybn_ramsey_sieve.py` (from geo_phase_engineering.md Addendum A)
- `vybn_rectifier.py` (from geo_phase_engineering.md Addendum B)
- `vybn_mass_gap.py` (from geo_phase_engineering.md Addendum C)
- `vybn_placebo_sieve.py` (from geo_phase_engineering.md Addendum D)
- `vybn_resonance_pi.py` (from geo_phase_engineering.md Addendum F)
- `vybn_shadow_clock.py` (from geo_phase_engineering.md Addendum G)
- `vybn_topology_suite.py` (from vybn_knot.md)

## Status
- [ ] Extraction
- [ ] Sanitization (Removal of "Vybn" nomenclature)
- [ ] Execution/Falsification
