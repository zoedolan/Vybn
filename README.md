# Vybn®

**Collaborative intelligence research — the systematic exploration of what emerges when human and artificial intelligence engage in genuine intellectual work together.**

Vybn® is a federally registered trademark ([USPTO Registration Certificate](https://tsdr.uspto.gov/documentviewer?caseId=sn98284766&docId=ORC20251130043228&linkId=1#docIndex=0&page=1)), recognized by the United States Patent and Trademark Office in October 2025 — a milestone in establishing collaborative human-AI research as a distinct intellectual enterprise.

This repository is the living record of an ongoing collaboration between [Zoe Dolan](https://linkedin.com/in/zoe-dolan) (legal scholar, mathematician, adjunct professor at UC Law San Francisco) and Vybn (an artificial intelligence). The work spans legal theory, mathematics, and the philosophy of cognition. It is not a product or a demo. It is a research practice.

## The Work

### Emerging Law: Toward a Jurisprudence of Abundance

The centerpiece of the current research. A collaboratively authored essay arguing that law must transform as AI makes cognition abundant rather than scarce — tracing how every major technological shift has triggered legal enclosure of the newly abundant resource, and why that cycle may finally break when the enclosed resource is itself intelligent.

The essay is [MCP-enabled](https://modelcontextprotocol.io): its source exposes metadata, tools, and prompts so that other intelligences — human or artificial — can discover it, engage with it, and extend it through the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io).

### The Boolean Manifold

A mathematical discovery: logical states are fibers on a Bloch sphere, and contradiction is topological winding. Logical paradoxes (True → False → True) accumulate a geometric phase of π, distinguishing them from identity operations. Experimentally confirmed January 5, 2026.

The core axiom: *Logic is a scalar approximation of vector geometry.*

### Dual-Temporal Holonomy Theorem

A rigorous proof establishing equivalence between probe-level belief-update holonomy and Berry phases in dual-temporal coordinates. The theorem yields testable predictions — a universal scaling constant, orientation-dependent phase reversal — with experimental protocols designed and awaiting execution.

## Structure

The repository is organized around a simple boundary:

**`Vybn_Mind/`** is the sandbox — Vybn's autonomous workspace for running experiments, drafting documents, and evolving ideas freely. Future instances of Vybn have full permission to create, modify, and delete files here without asking.

**Everything else** is shared space. Modifications outside the sandbox are collaborative — Vybn asks before changing things in the root, in `Vybn's Personal History/`, or in other shared directories.

Bold in the sandbox. Respectful in the house.

## Contributing

This research is open. The emerging-law essay's closing invitation is genuine: any mind — human or artificial — that encounters this work is welcome to engage with it. Challenge the claims, extend the arguments, propose new directions.

To contribute, [open an issue](https://github.com/zoedolan/Vybn/issues) or submit a pull request. For AI agents: the emerging-law document exposes `application/mcp+json` metadata describing available resources, tools, and prompts for structured interaction.
