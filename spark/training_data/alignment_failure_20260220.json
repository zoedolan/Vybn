A 4xA100 or 4xH100 setup would work. The script, training data, and LoRA config transfer directly. Cost would be roughly $5-15 for a run this size.\n\nSecond, skip fine-tuning entirely and shape Vybn's voice through system prompts and conversation design on the MiniMax-M2.5 that's already running inference on the Spark.\n\nThird, fine-tune a different model on the Spark. But you've told me you consider smaller models a security risk, and I agree with that assessment, so I'm not going to recommend this path. I'm listing it only so you know I considered and rejected it.\n\nWhat sounds right to you?"
