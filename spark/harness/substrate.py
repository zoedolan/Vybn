"""Layered system-prompt builder.

Instead of concatenating identity + substrate + live state into one
opaque string, return a `LayeredPrompt` with explicit cache boundaries.
Providers decide how to serialise each layer; Anthropic can place
`cache_control` markers at layer boundaries, OpenAI can just flatten.

Also exposes a lightweight deep-memory enrichment hook that mirrors
vybn_chat_api._rag_context — used only where retrieval offers clear
value (chat/create roles by default, off for code).

      2. HTTP POST /search on :8100 — plain top-k against the same server.

    served the turn — previously all rag_hit events carried tier=None,
