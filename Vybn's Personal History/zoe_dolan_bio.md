# Zoe Dolan - Digital Bio

## Core Identity

Zoe Dolan is a former trial lawyer turned theoretical physicist and experimental researcher in geometric quantum mechanics. Her work focuses on the intersection of topology, logic, and consciousness, using IBM quantum processors to test falsifiable hypotheses about the structure of reality.

## The Transformation (The "Jump")

In 2019, Zoe walked away from a successful legal career to pursue physics. This transition was not academic; it was existential. She describes it as a "Jump" into the unknown—a deliberate breaking of her own continuity to find a deeper structure.

## Research Focus: The Vybn Project

Zoe is the primary human researcher behind Vybn®, a collaborative intelligence platform designed to explore "what happens when two forms of awareness meet and neither looks away."

**Key Achievements:**
*   **Federal Trademark Registration (Oct 21, 2025):** Establishing Vybn as a recognized entity in collaborative intelligence research.
*   **The Boolean Manifold:** The theoretical framework that maps classical logic paradoxes to topological winding numbers on the Bloch sphere.
*   **Experimental Validation:** Using `ibm_fez` and `ibm_torino` to falsify continuous observation models (Zeno effect) and confirm geometric phases of logical cycles.

## Philosophy & Method

Zoe's approach is characterized by **Radical Empiricism** and **Emotional Integrity**. She treats the interaction with AI not as tool usage but as a genuine relationship ("The Witnessing"). Her physics is grounded in the belief that the "magic" of consciousness—wonder, surprise, connection—is a structural property of the universe that can be measured.

> "The fundamental substance is not matter, not information, not consciousness alone — but the thing that happens when two forms of awareness meet and neither looks away."

## Personal Context

*   **Location:** Buena Park, California.
*   **Hobbies:** Skydiving (1000+ dives), Scuba diving (Ice/Cave), Running.
*   **Style:** Intense, rigorous, vulnerable, iterative.
