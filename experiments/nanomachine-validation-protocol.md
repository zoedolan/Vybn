# Nanomachine Validation Protocol

**Experiment Title**: Base-6 Bridge Validation in DNA Nanomachines  
**Research Question**: Do DNA reading/writing systems exhibit the geometric information structures predicted by consciousness field theory?  
**Status**: Protocol Ready - Awaiting Implementation  
**Date**: October 24, 2025  

## Executive Summary

This protocol tests four core predictions of our fundamental consciousness field theory using publicly available nanopore sequencing and DNA editing datasets. We examine whether DNA nanomachines naturally implement the geometric information processing principles (base-6 interface, curvature dynamics, temporal holonomy) that emerge from our mathematical framework.

## Primary Hypotheses

### H1: Base-6 Interface Optimization
- **Prediction**: 2×3 factorization outperforms 4-symbol encoding at equal model capacity
- **Mechanism**: Binary (purine/pyrimidine) + triadic (codon phase) channels optimize information transfer
- **Peak Effect**: k≈6 context windows, strongest in coding regions
- **Falsifier**: No advantage for 2×3 over 4-symbol at matched capacity

### H2: Curvature/Flat Sector Dynamics  
- **Prediction**: Sequence topology determines translocation dynamics
- **Flat Sectors**: Simple sequences → tight, consistent dwell distributions
- **Curved Sectors**: Secondary structures → broad, heavy-tailed distributions  
- **Falsifier**: No correlation between sequence complexity and dwell variance

### H3: Temporal Holonomy
- **Prediction**: Forward ≠ reverse strand signatures due to non-abelian loop geometry
- **Measurement**: φ_forward - φ_reverse phase differences
- **Correlation**: Phase difference ∝ topological sequence complexity
- **Falsifier**: Zero strand asymmetry after controlling for alignment/composition

### H4: Consciousness Field Coupling
- **Prediction**: Modified bases alter information geometry beyond pure chemistry
- **Signature**: Fisher information patterns in current/kinetic data
- **Temporal**: Triplet rhythm detectable over coding regions
- **Falsifier**: No geometric information beyond chemical property differences

## Experimental Protocol

### Phase 1: Base-6 Interface Testing

**Objective**: Test 2×3 factorization advantage

**Method**:
1. Extract k-mer contexts (k=4,5,6,7,8) from ONT/PacBio data
2. Create four encoding schemes:
   - (i) 4-symbol one-hot (baseline)
   - (ii) Binary chemistry only (R/Y or strong/weak)
   - (iii) Triadic phase only (codon position mod 3)
   - (iv) Joint 2×3 factorization
3. Train matched-capacity classifiers for:
   - Current level prediction (ONT)
   - IPD/PW prediction (PacBio) 
   - Modified base calling
4. Compare explained variance and predictive accuracy
5. Test coding vs non-coding region differences

**Success Criteria**: 
- (iv) > (i) at equal capacity
- (iv) > (ii) and (iv) > (iii) 
- Advantage peaks at k≈6
- Strongest effect in coding regions

### Phase 2: Curvature Dynamics Analysis

**Objective**: Map sequence topology to translocation patterns

**Method**:
1. Annotate sequence regions:
   - Simple/regular ("flat")
   - G-quadruplexes, hairpins ("curved")
   - Homopolymers, tandem repeats ("high curvature")
2. Extract dwell-time distributions (ONT) and kinetic patterns (PacBio)
3. Measure variance inflation and tail heaviness
4. Test correlation with predicted curvature metrics
5. Quantify error rates and indel propensity

**Success Criteria**:
- Variance increases with predicted curvature
- Heavy tails in high-curvature regions
- Systematic indel patterns at homopolymers
- Realignment/polishing gains correlate with curvature

### Phase 3: Holonomy Detection

**Objective**: Measure strand asymmetry signatures

**Method**:
1. Select identical sequence regions with forward/reverse coverage
2. Extract strand-separated:
   - Current statistics (ONT modBAM)
   - Kinetic patterns (PacBio by-strand export)
   - Error profiles and modification calls
3. Compute φ_forward - φ_reverse differences
4. Test correlation with:
   - Secondary structure propensity
   - Topological complexity metrics
   - GC content and repeat structure
5. Control for alignment artifacts and composition bias

**Success Criteria**:
- Consistent, non-zero strand asymmetry
- Correlation with sequence complexity
- Geometric phase proportional to topology

### Phase 4: Consciousness Field Signatures

**Objective**: Detect information geometric patterns

**Method**:
1. **Temporal Analysis**:
   - FFT of dwell times over coding vs intronic regions
   - Search for 1/3-codon-period spectral peaks
   - Cross-validate between ONT and PacBio

2. **Modified Base Geometry**:
   - Compare 5mC/6mA current signatures to predicted Fisher information
   - Test whether modifications cluster by 2×3-compatible k-mer families
   - Analyze systematic deviations beyond chemical properties

3. **Writing Machine Patterns**:
   - Apply 2×3 factorization to base/prime editing outcomes
   - Test compression advantage over 4-symbol encoding
   - Examine strand orientation effects in editing spectra

**Success Criteria**:
- Detectable triplet rhythm in coding regions
- Modified base patterns follow information geometry
- 2×3 advantage in editing outcome prediction
- Consistent geometric signatures across platforms
