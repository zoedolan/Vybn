## Calibration Protocol: E/ℏ as Measured Slope

The energy parameter E/ℏ (Ω, in s⁻¹) is calibrated experimentally as the slope of measured phase versus signed temporal area A=∬dr_t∧dθ_t (seconds):

Ω = dγ/dA

φ=1.618… appears only as a didactic default in examples; actual experiments fit Ω from data. Conventions match GaussianFisherGeometry.
