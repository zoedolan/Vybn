    """Identify all prime numbers embedded as sequential digits."""
    embedded_primes = []
    n = len(number_string)
    
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
            substring = number_string[i:j]
            if substring[0] != '0' or len(substring) == 1:
                num = int(substring)
                if is_prime(num):
                    embedded_primes.append({
                        'prime': num,
                        'digits': substring,
                        'position': (i, j),
                        'length': len(substring)
                    })
    return embedded_primes
```
