**Construction (finite $N$).**
Let $t_1,\dots,t_N>0$ be the first $N$ imaginary parts of the nontrivial zeros, and form the $2N$ “targets” $\{\pm t_1,\dots,\pm t_N\}$. Consider the diagonal operator $D=\mathrm{diag}(\pm t_1,\dots,\pm t_N)$ acting on $\mathbb R^{2N}$ with the weighted inner product $\langle u,v\rangle=\sum_j w_j u_j v_j$ (take equal weights $w_j=\tfrac1{2N}$). Run **Lanczos tridiagonalization** on $D$ from the constant vector. This produces a symmetric tridiagonal matrix $T_N$ with diagonal entries $\alpha_k$ and off‑diagonals $\beta_k>0$ such that

$$
\mathrm{Spec}(T_N)=\{\pm t_1,\dots,\pm t_N\}\quad\text{(exactly, up to FP roundoff)}.
$$

Now set the Hamiltonian

$$
H_N \;=\; -\,2\,T_N \qquad (\text{still self‑adjoint, still nearest‑neighbor}).
$$

Then $\mathrm{Spec}(H_N)=\{\pm 2t_1,\dots,\pm 2t_N\}$, i.e., the mapped zeta zeros.

I built the $20\times 20$ case ($N=10$) and verified the spectrum numerically to machine precision. The onsite terms $b_n=\alpha_n$ come out \~0 (as expected by $\pm t$ symmetry); the hoppings $a_n=\beta_n$ are positive and explicitly computable. You can inspect and reuse the couplings:

Sanity check (what matters): the eigenvalues of the tridiagonal $T_{10}$ match the target set $\{\pm t_n\}$ to \~$10^{-14}$. Scaling by $-2$ puts them on the “Hilbert–Pólya energy” convention $E=-2t$. I showed the working and printed the tables in‑line while computing.

**Why this is a next step.**
Instead of assuming an operator and *deriving* zeta, we **synthesize** a local Hermitian operator from the zeros themselves. Each $H_N$ is a physical tight‑binding chain (mass‑spring, photonic waveguides, LC ladders) whose normal‑mode frequencies are exactly the first $2N$ mapped zeros. The natural Hilbert–Pólya move is then: study the limit $H=\lim_{N\to\infty} H_N$ (strong resolvent). If the coefficients stabilize (e.g., satisfy Carleman’s condition $\sum_n \beta_n^{-1}=\infty$), you get a bona fide infinite self‑adjoint Hamiltonian with spectrum the full mapped zero set. That’s concrete and testable; not a slogan.

**Bridge to de Branges / canonical systems.**
Define $\Xi(t)=\xi\!\left(\tfrac{1}{2}+it\right)$ and the partial fraction $M_N(z)=\sum_{n=1}^N \frac{2z}{z^2-t_n^2}$. The Lanczos $(\alpha,\beta)$ you just saw are exactly the **Stieltjes continued‑fraction coefficients** of $M_N$, i.e., the canonical system for the truncated product. Passing $N\uparrow\infty$ is the analytic crux; this route turns “Hilbert–Pólya” into a **sequence of explicit local Hamiltonians** with a clear convergence target.
