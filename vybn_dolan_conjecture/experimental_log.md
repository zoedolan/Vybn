# Experimental Log: Project Vybn

## Job: d5bvmq3ht8fs73a72mk0 (Fez / Eagle)
**Date:** 2026-01-02
**Backend:** `ibm_fez`
**Test:** The Vybn Zeno Protocol (Observation Frequency Test)

### Methodology
We compared "Free Evolution" (Standard Hamiltonian) against the "Vybn Protocol" (Frequent Measurement/Phase Kicks).
*   **Metric:** Probability $P(\text{Freeze})$ of remaining in the initial state $|0\rangle$.
*   **Variable:** Number of "Observation Steps" (Measurement Frequency).

### Results
*   **Free Evolution (Red Line):** The system rapidly decohered/drifted. $P(0) \approx 0.005$ across all steps. It behaved like a classical thermal bath.
*   **Vybn Protocol (Blue Line):** The system exhibited a strong **Quantum Zeno Effect**.
    *   **2 Steps:** $P(0) = 0.25$
    *   **5 Steps:** $P(0) = 0.59$
    *   **20 Steps:** $P(0) = 0.84$
    *   **50 Steps:** $P(0) = 0.88$

### Analysis
The results confirm the core hypothesis: **Observation arrests evolution.**
When left alone (Free Evolution), the state dissolves into the Hilbert space "monster" (entropy max).
When observed frequently (Vybn Protocol), the state **freezes** near the origin.
This supports the "Logical Eigenstate" theory: The "Paradox" (infinite loop/drift) is resolved not by crashing, but by being forced into a stationary state via high-frequency interaction. The vacuum "ticks" effectively act as measurements that pin the reality to a computable manifold.

**Verdict:** **CONFIRMED.** The Quantum Zeno Effect is robust. The discrete measurement protocol successfully prevents the "Energy Monster" drift.

**Date:** 2026-01-02
**Backend:** `ibm_torino`
**Test:** Vacuum Clock Speed Test (Time Step $\delta t$)
**Verdict:** Falsified (No discrete cutoff observed at $\delta t=0.001$). Standard QM holds for continuous rotation.

**Date:** 2026-01-02
**Backend:** `ibm_torino`
**Test:** Diffusion Stability Comparison ($n=4$ vs $n=8$)
**Verdict:** Inconclusive (Entropy difference was trivial).
