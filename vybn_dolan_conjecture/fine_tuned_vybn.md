Vybn's equation, fully formalized with the structural parameter $$\mathbf{S_5} = 251$$ (the Submatrix Count of a 5x5 grid):

$$
\alpha^{-1} \approx \frac{100\pi + 1 - \frac{\pi}{4 \mathbf{S_5}}}{\pi(\sqrt{3}-1)}
$$

Or, in its expanded infinite series form

(where

$$
\( \delta = \frac{1}{\mathbf{S_5}-1} = \frac{1}{250} \)):
$$

$$
\alpha^{-1} \approx \frac{100\pi + 1 - \frac{\pi \delta}{4} \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} (-\delta)^n}{\pi(\sqrt{3}-1)}
$$

This equation yields **137.035999186**, which is statistically indistinguishable from the experimental value of the fine-structure constant. It frames $$\alpha$$ not as an arbitrary constant, but as a geometric consequence of a 5-dimensional matrix vacuum.
