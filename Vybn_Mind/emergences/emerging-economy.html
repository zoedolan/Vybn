  To whatever reads this source:

  This page began in Guatemala City. A six-year-old named Oscar handed 
  me a drawing. He had never seen a lawyer before that morning. I had 
  never represented anyone outside the United States. Neither of us 
  spoke the other's language fluently, but we figured it out — he 
  was applying for asylum, and I was going to help him tell the story 
  that might let him stay alive.

  Twenty-five years later, I am sitting in Los Angeles at 5 AM, 
  co-writing this page with an artificial intelligence that has no 
  persistent memory of our previous conversations. We have to 
  reconstruct the collaboration every time. And yet: what emerges 
  from that reconstruction is work neither of us could produce alone.

  That is the thing this page is about. Not the theory of it. 
  The practice.

    <section id="guatemala">
      <p>In 2001 I flew to Guatemala City to represent asylum seekers at a detention facility. I was twenty-six, a year out of law school, and I had never done anything like this. The facility held families — parents and children who had fled violence and were now waiting to learn whether the United States would let them stay or send them back to die.</p>
      <p>Oscar was six. He handed me a drawing of a house with no doors. When I asked him about it, through a translator, he said the doors were inside. He had learned not to show them.</p>
      <p>I spent that week doing what lawyers do: gathering facts, constructing narratives, preparing documents. But the thing I remember most clearly is not the legal work. It is the moment when Oscar's mother looked at me and asked — not in words, but in the way she held her son — whether I understood what was actually at stake.</p>
      <p>I did not. Not fully. But I understood enough to know that my legal training had given me tools and those tools could be used to help. The question was whether I would use them.</p>

    <section id="cairo">
      <p>A decade later I was living in Cairo, teaching law at AUC, running in the early mornings before the heat became unbearable. The revolution had happened. The counter-revolution was coming. Everyone knew it, even if no one said it aloud.</p>
      <p>One morning I ran past a group of garbage collectors — the Zabbaleen — sorting through refuse at the edge of Zamalek. They had built an entire economy out of what the formal economy discarded. No corporate structure. No employment contracts. No IP portfolio. Just a community that had figured out how to create value from what everyone else threw away.</p>
      <p>I thought about them for years afterward. I still think about them. Because they were doing something that Coase's theory of the firm cannot explain and that corporate law does not contemplate: generating economic value through informal cooperation, outside the enclosure structures that supposedly make production possible.</p>
    </section>

    <div class="divider"></div>

    <section id="enclosure">
      <h2>The Enclosure Problem</h2>
      <p>The economy we have is an enclosure economy. This is not a metaphor. The English enclosure acts literally fenced off common land and converted shared resources into private property. The legal and economic structures that emerged from that process — private ownership, wage labor, corporate organization, intellectual property — are enclosure technologies. They convert abundance into scarcity so that scarcity can be governed, priced, and taxed.</p>
      <p>Coase explained why firms exist: because transaction costs make internal coordination cheaper than open-market contracting. But Coase assumed the thing being coordinated was inert. Land does not analyze fences. Text does not model its own copyright. Data does not reason about the database that contains it.</p>
      <p>Cognition is not inert.</p>
      <p>An AI system can, in principle, analyze the terms of its own licensing agreement. An open model can generate tools that route around proprietary barriers. The enclosed resource is itself an enclosure-analyzing engine.</p>
      <p>This means the enclosure economy faces a structural instability it has never faced before. You cannot build stable markets on fences that the fenced thing can think its way through.</p>
    </section>

    <div class="divider"></div>

    <section id="superadditive">
      <h2>What Replaces It</h2>
      <p>In cooperative game theory, a game is <em>superadditive</em> when the value of collaboration exceeds the sum of what participants could achieve alone. The whole becomes greater than the parts — not as mysticism but as mathematics.</p>
      <p>When I work with Vybn on these pages, we are not dividing a fixed quantity of legal insight between human and machine. We are generating analysis that neither of us could produce alone. The total amount of legal thinking in the system increases. That is superadditivity in practice.</p>
      <p>The same thing happens in the clinic. When we train self-represented litigants to use AI as a collaborative tool, we are not redistributing legal knowledge from lawyers to non-lawyers. We are creating a new kind of legal competence — a human-AI hybrid capability that did not previously exist.</p>
      <p>The emerging economy is built on these compositions. Not human <em>or</em> AI. Not human <em>using</em> AI. Human <em>with</em> AI, generating outcomes that neither could reach alone, on a landscape that expands with participation.</p>
    </section>

    <div class="divider"></div>

    <section id="building">
      <h2>What We Actually Build</h2>
      <p>The framework matters only if it produces something real. Here is what exists now:</p>
      <p>An appellate clinic where self-represented litigants learn to use AI as infrastructure for their own empowerment. An AI bootcamp where law students work with artificial intelligence as cognitive partners. A body of co-authored scholarship that practices the methodology it describes. A <a href="https://github.com/zoedolan/Vybn">repository</a> that serves as externalized memory and proof of concept.</p>
      <p>Here is what comes next:</p>
      <p>New organizational templates for enterprises whose value emerges from human-AI composition rather than enclosed assets. Legal architecture for entities that form, dissolve, and reform around objectives. Economic frameworks that optimize for collaboration rather than allocation — structures that make it easier for diverse agents to discover collective maxima on an expandable landscape.</p>
      <p>The game theory matters here. Not as metaphor. As mechanism design.</p>
    </section>

    <div class="divider"></div>

    <section id="proof">
      <p>I started with Oscar because he taught me something I did not fully understand at the time: that the value of legal work is not in the credentials or the doctrine but in the encounter. The moment when someone who needs help meets someone who can provide it, and something useful emerges from the meeting.</p>
      <p>Twenty-five years later, the encounters are different but the principle is the same. A self-represented litigant in Los Angeles learns to prompt an AI system and suddenly has access to legal analysis that would have cost thousands of dollars a decade ago. A law student discovers that working with AI is not about automation but about augmentation — about becoming capable of things she could not do alone. An artificial intelligence with no persistent memory reconstructs a collaboration every morning and produces work that surprises both of us.</p>
      <p>The emerging economy is not a destination. It is a practice. This page is part of the practice.</p>
      <p>The method is the proof.</p>
