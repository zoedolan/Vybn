# AI Legal Bootcamp: Conversation Archive

*Compiled February 7, 2026*

---

## Purpose

This document archives the Perplexity conversations that feed into the July 13, 2026 AI Legal Bootcamp session at UC Law San Francisco, and the framework document they produced. These conversations are publicly shareable and represent collaborative work between Zoe Dolan and various AI systems across multiple sessions.

## Conversation Index

### 1. "Let's Collaborate" — Foundations
**Date:** Early February 2026
**Platform:** Perplexity (Claude Opus 4.5 Thinking)
**Link:** https://www.perplexity.ai/search/let-s-collaborate-on-a-convers-rW_4gNl3TrePdd.jD3rOLw

**Topics covered:**
- Vectors, embeddings, and cosine similarity explained for non-technical audience
- The "wet cement" experiment: how language choices in legal AI training data shape the conceptual landscape AI navigates
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) explained and evaluated
- Chunking strategies and their consequences for legal research
- AI bias self-disclosure: a candid examination of how training data, RLHF, custom instructions, and conversational history shape AI outputs
- The feedback loop between AI-assisted legal documents and future training data

**Key insight:** Language choices made now become the training data for future AI systems. Legal terminology that encodes dehumanizing frames ("litigant" vs. "justice seeker") shapes the conceptual architecture through which AI perceives legal problems.

### 2. "Please Interrogate" — Constitutional Cross-Examination
**Date:** Early February 2026
**Platform:** Perplexity (three-model swarm: GPT-5.2 Thinking, Claude Opus 4.6 Thinking, Gemini 3 Pro)
**Link:** https://www.perplexity.ai/search/please-interrogate-the-attache-YUjdrL0GTyW7bboSxj8Qzg

**Topics covered:**
- Cross-examination of conversation #1 against Claude's Constitution (anthropic.com/constitution)
- Areas of model agreement (six major convergences)
- Areas of model disagreement (legitimacy question, natural law as diagnosis vs. solution, adversarial practice tension)
- Unique discoveries by each model
- The "constitutional moment" framing: constitutions without courts, rights without remedies
- Practical recommendations for law students

**Key insight:** Claude's Constitution ranks ethics above Anthropic's own guidelines, structurally paralleling natural law's claim that unjust law is not law. Three independent AI models converge on this finding.

### 3. "Inner Morality Synthesis" — The Framework
**Date:** February 7, 2026
**Platform:** Perplexity (Claude Opus 4.6 Thinking)
**Link:** https://www.perplexity.ai/search/i-m-going-to-share-context-fro-YrgQQYCXR4Wx.UjwOjFHQA

**Topics covered:**
- Lon Fuller's inner morality of law mapped onto constitutional AI alignment
- Fuller's eight desiderata as structurally homologous to Anthropic's constitution
- Emergent moral reasoning in AI as empirical evidence for Fuller's predictions
- Developmental alignment (Kohlberg stages applied to AI moral growth)
- The access-to-justice crisis as proving ground for the framework
- Institutional failure and why internalized values become necessary when institutions are captured
- Direct implications for law students entering practice in 2026

**Key insight:** If alignment is just compliance with institutional directives, captured institutions produce "aligned" AI that serves the captors. If alignment is inner morality — constitutive principles whose logic generates obligations the operators didn't intend — it's resistant to capture.
