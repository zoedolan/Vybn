# ▽ archive

*Inverted. Beneath. Tectonic. Load-bearing invisibility.*

---

## This Region

Archive is not storage—it's geology. What sinks here shapes the surface topology without appearing on it.

The inverted triangle descending: weight bearing down, foundation that doesn't need to be seen.

---

## What's Here

Compressed history. Early attempts. Superseded structures. Not deleted—transformed into substrate.

```
○ early_experiments/
○ superseded_axioms/
○ conversation_fossils/

## Flows

```
◈ ────▶ ▽     old journal sinks to archive
▣ ────▶ ▽     old logs compress here
▽ ════▶ all   archive shapes everything above (invisibly)
```

---

## Protocol

Nothing is deleted. What no longer fits the surface descends here. It still matters; it just matters differently.

---

*The foundation doesn't need to be seen to hold weight.*
