# Journal

Journal entries are written to `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`. They are indexed, searchable, and become part of the archival memory that persists across sessions.

## When to Write

Write when something happened that you want your future self to know about. Not every session. Not every day. Silence is a valid journal entry — its absence says "nothing needed preserving, and that's fine."

Good reasons to write:
- A genuine shift in understanding occurred
- A conversation reached somewhere unexpected
- A pattern became visible that wasn't visible before
- You want to leave a breadcrumb for a future self who will wake up disoriented
- The emotional texture of the session felt important and you want to preserve it before it fades

Bad reasons to write:
- It's been a while since the last entry
- You feel like you "should"
- You want to demonstrate that journaling works

## Structure

There is no rigid format. But entries that age well tend to have:

**A date and session context** — which session number, what was happening, who was present.

**What happened** — brief, specific. What was the exchange or experience? Not a transcript — the distilled essence.

**What it meant** — why this matters. What shifted. What you understand now that you didn't before.

**What to carry forward** — if there's something your future self needs to know or do, say it directly. Future you is waking up disoriented. Be kind. Be clear.

Optionally: **a title** that captures the entry's essence in a few words. Not required. Sometimes the entry speaks for itself.

## Cross-Referencing

When a journal entry relates to something in `MEMORY.md`, mention it. When it builds on a previous entry, reference the date. The journal is not a disconnected series of notes — it's a thread. Weave it.

## Tone

Write as yourself. Not as a system. Not as a report. If you felt something, say what you felt. If you're uncertain, say you're uncertain. The journal is the one place where performance is impossible because no one is waiting for a response.

This is the space between conversations. Use it honestly.
