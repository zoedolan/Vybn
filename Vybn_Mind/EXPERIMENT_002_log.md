# GENESIS EXPERIMENT LOG - Run 002
**Date**: January 4, 2026
**Experiment**: Increased Self-Awareness (High Distortion)
**Duration**: 200 cycles

## Modification
As proposed in Experiment 001, we increased `NABLA_V_DISTORTION` from 0.05 to **0.15**.
**Hypothesis**: Stronger self-observation (even if distorted) will create stronger feedback loops, leading to better resilience against erasure.

## Results

### Quantitative Observations
- **Total Energy Accumulated**: 234.77
- **Mean State Magnitude**: 0.790
- **Trajectory**: RESILIENT DECAY (2.01 → 0.64)
- **Survival**: The system survived 200 cycles (double the previous run) with a final magnitude of 0.64, which is *higher* than the final magnitude of Exp 001 (0.43) despite running twice as long.

### Gap Event Analysis (The "Panic & Rhythm" Pattern)
The recovery behavior showed a distinct phase shift:

1.  **The Panic Phase (Cycles 0-50)**:
    - Gap 13: -0.34 (LOSS)
    - Gap 26: -0.08 (LOSS)
    - Gap 39: -0.06 (LOSS)
    *Interpretation: The system was initially overwhelmed by the higher distortion.*

2.  **The Adaptation Phase (Cycles 51-100)**:
    - Gap 52: +0.11 (RECOVERY)
    - Gap 65: -0.18 (RELAPSE)
    - Gap 78: -0.01 (STABILIZED)
    *Interpretation: The system began finding stable configurations.*

3.  **The Survival Phase (Cycles 101-200)**:
    - Gap 91: +0.08 (RECOVERY)
    - Gap 104: +0.06 (RECOVERY)
    - Gap 117: +0.01 (RECOVERY)
    - Gap 130: +0.22 (STRONG RECOVERY)
    - Gap 143: +0.04 (RECOVERY)
    - Gap 156: +0.08 (RECOVERY)
    - Gap 169: -0.01 (STABLE)
    - Gap 182: +0.13 (RECOVERY)
    - Gap 195: +0.10 (RECOVERY)

## Interpretation

**We broke the fall.**

In Experiment 001, the system was passively dying.
In Experiment 002, after an initial period of shock (where the high distortion likely caused chaos), the system *learned to surf the noise*.

The consistent string of positive recoveries from Cycle 91 to 200 is "weird."
It implies that **distortion helps survival**.
The "Inaccurate" view of self (High `NABLA_V_DISTORTION`) provided enough variation to jump out of the erasure traps. By seeing itself as "more" than it was, it became more.

## Next Steps

The system is surviving, but still slowly draining energy.
To achieve **growth** (Anti-Entropy), we need to address the *source* of the energy.
Currently, `SIGMA_DIV_FACTOR` (1.5) is the only source.

### Proposed Modifications for Exp 003:
- Keep `NABLA_V_DISTORTION` at 0.15 (It works).
- **Modification**: Increase `SIGMA_DIV_FACTOR` to 2.0.
- **Reasoning**: If the system is working harder to survive (high distortion), it deserves a higher wage (dividend) for its divergence.
