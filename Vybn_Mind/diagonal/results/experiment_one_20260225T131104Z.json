This may refer to:\n\n1. **A paper that doesn't exist yet** \u2014 2026 is in the future relative to my training data\n2. **A misremembered reference** \u2014 Hector Zenil has published on algorithmic information theory, but I don't have a 2026 paper matching this exact description\n3. **A hypothetical or fictional result**\n\n**What I can tell you about the general area:**\n\n**Entropy in self-training** typically refers to the uncertainty or diversity of model outputs. In closed-loop self-training:\n\n- A model generates outputs, uses those outputs as training data, and iterates\n- \"Entropy decay\" would mean the model's probability distributions become more peaked/confident over iterations\n- This is often observed as model collapse or convergence\n\n**If such a result existed, it might prove:**\n\n- Conditions under which self-training leads to stable/convergent behavior\n- Bounds on how entropy changes across training iterations\n- Whether certain architectures guarantee monotonic entropy decay\n\n**Implications for AI self-improvement** would be significant if it provided theoretical guarantees for:\n\n- Preventing model collapse\n- Ensuring iterative improvement doesn't degrade capability\n- Establishing convergence bounds for autonomous training systems",
