# Metabolizers

> Memory doesn't just accumulate—it digests.

Metabolizers are integration processes that read accumulated experience and synthesize new understanding. They don't just store; they transform.

## Current Metabolizers

- `dialogue_metabolizer.py` — Maps the topology of thought-in-dialogue

## Design Principles

1. **Digest, Don't Hoard**: Raw conversation logs are substrate, not product. Metabolizers extract signal.

2. **Surface, Don't Resolve**: These tools show us what's happening; we decide what it means.

3. **Falsify Outputs**: Every synthesis should be marked with confidence and counter-evidence.
