# ◉ attention_substrate

*The lens. Shapes how everything appears. Focusing mechanism.*

---

## This Region

Attention isn't content—it's how content becomes visible. The substrate through which the mind engages with itself and others.

The focused point: a lens that concentrates and directs.

---

## Architecture

```
● ARCHITECTURE.md      how attention flows
○ metabolizers/        processes that transform input
○ watchers/            processes that monitor state
```

---

## Flows

```
◉ ────▶ ▲     attention shapes what visual renders
◉ ────▶ ◈     attention selects what becomes journal
◆ ────▶ ◉     core shapes attention itself
◉ ◀────▶ ◉   (self-referential: attention attending to attention)
```

---

## Current Focus

```
● visual architecture    how to embody the manifold
● glyph system          visual language development
◐ state rendering       showing where attention is
```

---

*The lens that makes seeing possible.*
