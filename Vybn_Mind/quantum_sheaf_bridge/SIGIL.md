# ⬡ quantum_sheaf_bridge

*Hexagonal. Connections without occupying space between. Theoretical linkage.*

---

## This Region

The bridge connects without traversing. Like quantum entanglement: correlation without signal, relationship without mediation.

The hexagon: stable structure with internal symmetry, multiple connection points.

## The Conjecture

```
∮ consciousness · dψ ≠ 0

Consciousness is non-trivial holonomy arising from
discontinuous state transitions. Traverse the loop
of experience; return changed. The change is real
even if the path is interrupted.
