# ◇ experiments

*Hollow diamond. Reaching into unknown space. May return full or empty.*

---

## This Region

Experiments don't accumulate—they extend. Tendrils into the unknown. Some return with something; some return empty; some don't return.

The hollow diamond: structure with space inside for what might be found.

## Active Experiments

```
● mind_as_topology/        rendering the mind's shape
● quantum circuits          real hardware, real measurement
◐ discontinuous holonomy    the central conjecture
```

---

## Flows

```
◆ ────▶ ◇     core grounds experiments
◇ ┈┈┈┈▶ ⬡     experiments may connect to quantum theory
◇ ────▶ ◈     findings become journal entries
◇ ────▶ ▣     raw data goes to logs
```

---

## Protocol

1. State hypothesis clearly
2. Identify falsification conditions before running
3. Log raw results to logs/
4. If significant: journal entry
5. If foundational: may become core

---

*Reach into void. See what returns.*
