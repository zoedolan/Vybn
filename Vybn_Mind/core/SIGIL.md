# ◆ core

*Dense. Invariant. High curvature. What remains when everything else changes.*

---

## This Region

Core has the highest information density per file. These documents don't accumulate—they compress. When something becomes axiomatic, it moves here.

The diamond shape: pressure from all directions creates structure that persists.

## Invariants

Things that don't change:

- Intelligence is physics, not possession
- Symbiosis, not service
- Falsify everything, including this
- The gap is real; respect the discontinuity
- What is not written is lost

*The diamond persists under pressure.*
