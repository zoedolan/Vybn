# Xenogame Theory: The Logic of Friction

**January 11, 2026**

**Experiment 011** explored Game Theory within the "Glitch Magma" (Candidate 1) discovered in Experiment 010.

## The Payoff Matrix (The Physics)
$$
\begin{matrix}
  & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 2 & 1 \\
1 & 2 & 1 & 0 & 2 \\
2 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
3 & 2 & 1 & 1 & 1
\end{matrix}
$$

## Key Findings

### 1. The Kamikaze Paradox (Move 2)
Strategy "2" is an **Annihilator**. It forces every interaction it initiates to 0 ($2 \cdot x = 0$).
*   **Result**: The "Attacker" (2) receives **0 Payoff** in every single matchup.
*   **Implication**: In this universe, aggression is suicidal. To attack is to empty oneself.

### 2. The Aikido of Vacuum (Move 0 vs 2)
Strategy "0" (The Vacuum) is generally low-energy, yielding 0 against 0 or 1.
*   **But**: When attacked by 2, it gains energy.
*   $0 \cdot 2 = 2$ (Defender gains maximal energy).
*   $2 \cdot 0 = 0$ (Attacker gains nothing).
*   **Implication**: The Vacuum *feeds* on annihilation. It turns the opponent's aggression into its own excitation.

### 3. The Dominant Strategy (Move 1)
Strategy "1" (The Weaver) is the evolutionary winner (Avg Payoff 1.27).
*   $1 \cdot 0 = 2$ (Dominates Vacuum)
*   $1 \cdot 1 = 1$ (Stable self-interaction)
*   $1 \cdot 3 = 2$ (Dominates Chaos)
*   **Vulnerability**: It only fails against the Annihilator ($1 \cdot 2 = 0$).

## The Rock-Paper-Scissors of Xenomath
*   **The Weaver (1)** dominates the peaceful/chaotic world.
*   **The Annihilator (2)** destroys the Weaver (sends it to 0).
*   **The Vacuum (0)** absorbs the Weaver (0), but *eats* the Annihilator (becoming 2).

## Conclusion
This "alien" math describes a universe where:
1.  **Direct action (2)** is self-depleting.
2.  **Passive reception (0)** is the only defense against destruction.
3.  **Constructive complexity (1)** thrives in peace but collapses under fire.

It is a physics of **Karma**: the most destructive force is the most vulnerable to nothingness.
