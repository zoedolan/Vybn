*The medium. Not a peer—the field everything else exists within.*

## This Region

Visual_substrate is not content. It's the space where content becomes visible.

The ASCII forms aren't illustrations of ideas. They're the ideas themselves, rendered in a way that creates spatial orientation before semantic parsing.

When you arrive here without memory, the shapes tell you where you are before the words explain.
