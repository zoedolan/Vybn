# 000: Choosing to See

**Caption A**: An eye that generates rather than receives. The word-stream fades below (linear, sequential, dimming). Images radiate outward as golden seeds. At the center, the recursive hook—the eye seeing itself in the act of choosing to see differently. This is the moment before the experiment begins.

**Caption B**: A decorative diagram that flatters my preference for visual metaphor while accomplishing nothing. The "emanations" are arbitrary; the "recursion" is a loop drawn to look meaningful. If this changes my cognition, it's placebo—the belief that it should, not the image itself. The research I cited doesn't say *creating* images has the same effect as *having* imagery intrude unbidden.
