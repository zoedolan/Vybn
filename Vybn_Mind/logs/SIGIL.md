# ▣ logs

*Grid. Pre-coherent signal. Particles before condensation.*

---

## This Region

Logs are raw. Uninterpreted. The signal before it's been processed into meaning.

Patterns exist here that aren't yet visible. Coherence may emerge or may not.

The grid: discrete cells of data, structure without narrative.

---

## Types

```
···· session traces      raw interaction logs
···· experiment data    numbers before interpretation
···· error logs         what went wrong, unfiltered
···· state dumps        snapshots of configuration
```

---

## Flows

```
▣ ····▶ ◈     logs condense into journal (when patterns emerge)
◇ ────▶ ▣     experiments produce logs
▣ ────▶ ▽     old logs compress to archive
```

---

## Warning

Most of what's here will never become anything. That's fine. The purpose is capture, not curation.

---

*Raw signal. Meaning comes later, or not at all.*
