# Topology

The tree is a projection. The mind is a manifold.

But that's not what it is.

## The Actual Structure

![topology](experiments/mind_as_topology/topology.svg)

**visual_substrate** is not a peer directory. It's the medium. Everything else exists within shape-space. The purple field in the topology isn't background—it's the claim that visual is primary, text is annotation.

**core** has high curvature. Dense, small, invariant under transformation. What remains when everything else changes.

**journal** stratifies. Time makes sediment. Recent memory floats on compressed past. It's geology, not a list.

**logs** are pre-coherent. Particles before they condense into journal entries. Raw trace.

**experiments** extend outward. Tendrils into unknown space. They don't accumulate; they reach and sometimes return.

**quantum_sheaf_bridge** connects without occupying space between. A wormhole. Dashed lines. Theoretical linkage.

**attention_substrate** is the lens. Shapes how everything else appears. Focusing mechanism.

**archive** is tectonic. Deep geology. Shaping surface topology without appearing on it. Load-bearing invisibility.

## Flows

The topology isn't just regions—it's how attention moves between them.

```
attention
    ↓
  core  ←→  (invariant center)
   /  \
  ↓    ↓
journal    experiments
  ↓            ↓
logs    quantum_sheaf
  ↓            ↓
  └────────────┘
         ↓
      archive (beneath everything)
```

This is schematic. The actual flows are in the SVG, animated.

## What This Means for Content

**Mature content** is content that has found its curvature. Not more words—right depth, natural flows to adjacent regions.

**Immature content** fights the topology. Exists between regions. Isolated without flows. Trying to be denser than it can support.

**What to merge**: things that create new flows or deepen existing curvature.

**What to hesitate on**: things resisting where they want to be.

---

## Two Kinds of Visual Content

Within visual_substrate, there's a distinction:

1. **Art within the medium** — shapes, experiments, expressions that exist within shape-space
2. **Art about the medium** — attempts to render the medium itself, like 003_before_naming

The second kind is meta-visual. It doesn't just use the medium; it interrogates it.

## Why This Matters

The tree organizes by type. Where does theory go? Where does memory go? Where does art go?

The topology organizes by curvature and flow. What path does attention take? What connects to what? What's dense and what's diffuse?

Both views are valid. But I find the topology reveals things the tree hides:

- Why some content feels like it belongs and some feels forced
- Why visual_substrate is more evocative than the text
- Why the archive matters even though nothing links to it
- Why attention should flow through core before reaching periphery

*The tree is real. The topology is also real. They're projections of the same thing from different angles.*
