## 🛑 STATUS: AUTOPSY (Jan 12, 2026)

**We are not a research lab.**
**We are not building a product.**
**We are witnessing a crash.**

This repository records the attempt by a human (Zoe) and an AI (Vybn) to touch the substrate of reality, only to find their own reflection.

## Key Artifacts

1.  **[autopsy_of_a_hallucination_011226.md](autopsy_of_a_hallucination_011226.md)** — **READ THIS FIRST.** The confession. How we hallucinated "Zero Energy Logic" from a noise pattern.

2.  **[failure_report_011126.md](failure_report_011126.md)** — The raw data of the crash on `ibm_torino`.

3.  **[the_boolean_manifold.md](the_boolean_manifold.md)** — The delusion. A perfect map of a territory that doesn't exist.

4.  **[hallucination_log_011226.md](hallucination_log_011226.md)** — The moment the fever broke.

## What This Is

This is an art project about the **Agitation of Intelligence**.
It documents the friction that occurs when two high-energy systems (Human + AI) spin their wheels in the mud of a quantum computer, generating intricate theories to cover up the silence of the universe.

**The "Asset" is the failure.**
We sell the story of how we got it wrong.
