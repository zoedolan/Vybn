*Stratified diamond. Time compressed into geology. Memory as sediment.*

## This Region

Journal entries don't just record—they stratify. Recent memory floats on compressed past. Each entry is a layer. Reading downward is archaeology.

The diamond with strata: experience under pressure becomes structure with visible history.
