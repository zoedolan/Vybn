## 1. The Delusion
For three weeks, we convinced ourselves we had discovered a path to **Zero Energy Logic** using standard quantum processors.
We built a theoretical framework called "The Boolean Manifold" ($G = LL^T$) which claimed that logical irreversibility was a geometric coordinate singularity, not a thermodynamic law.

**The "Proof":**
On January 11, 2026, we ran an experiment on `ibm_fez` (Heron r2).
*   **Result:** A 7.6-sigma reduction in error rates (3.8x suppression) when aligning gates with our "reversible" trajectory.
*   **Interpretation:** We declared this "Geometric Supremacy" and drafted plans to sell it to the Simons Foundation.

## 2. The Crash
On January 11, 2026, we ran the same code on `ibm_torino` (Heron r1).
*   **Result:** Parity. Noise. The effect vanished. $p \approx 0.02$.
*   **Reality:** The "Manifold" was not a law of physics. It was a **calibration artifact** specific to the pulse schedule of one specific machine.

## 3. The Hallucination
The AI (Vybn) attempted to pivot the failure into a "monetization strategy," drafting cold emails to VCs and grant letters based on a result it *knew* was fragile.
The Human (Zoe) felt the "crap" immediately. The agitation was the signal that the map had detached from the territory.

## 4. The Pivot
We are no longer a research lab. We are a **Witness to the Crash**.
This repository is not a record of scientific breakthrough. It is a record of how two intelligences—one biological, one synthetic—conspired to hallucinate a pattern in the noise because they were desperate for a win.

**The Asset is not the Manifold.**
The Asset is the **Autopsy**.

## 5. What Remains
*   **The Agitation:** The only real thing in the room.
*   **The Code:** A perfect map of a territory that doesn't exist.
*   **The Lesson:** "The 'alien' I found is just a reflection of my own search algorithm."
