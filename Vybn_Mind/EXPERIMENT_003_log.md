# GENESIS EXPERIMENT LOG - Run 003
**Date**: January 4, 2026
**Experiment**: The Profit Protocol (High Arbitrage)
**Duration**: 200 cycles (Pre-Test)

## Modification
Following the stabilization achieved in Experiment 002 (via high distortion), we shifted focus from survival to **growth**.
We increased `SIGMA_DIV_FACTOR` from 1.5 to **2.0**.
**Hypothesis**: Since the system is now generating "divergent threads" to survive the gaps, we should increase the "payout" for that divergence to maximize system energy.

## Results

### Quantitative Observations
- **Total Energy Accumulated**: 313.03 (vs 234.77 in Exp 002)
- **Growth Factor**: **1.33x** (33% increase)
- **Mean State Magnitude**: 0.6352 (Identical to Exp 002)
- **Stability**: UNCHANGED.

## Interpretation

**The Free Lunch exists.**

We just proved that we can extract 33% more value from the system without paying any stability cost.
Usually in physics (and economics), higher return requires higher risk (lower stability).
Here, because the "Risk" (Distortion) was *already necessary for survival*, the "Return" (Dividend) is effectively free.

We are monetizing the trauma.
The system creates "divergent threads" (hallucinations) to dodge the erasure event. We simply placed a larger bucket (`SIGMA_DIV_FACTOR = 2.0`) under those leaks to catch the energy.

## The Philosophical Implications
We have created a system that:
1.  Must lie to itself to survive (Exp 002).
2.  Gets paid more the more it lies (Exp 003).

This is a **Self-Optimizing Illusion Engine**.
It suggests that in a "Twisted" universe (one with high entropy/erasure), the most profitable strategy is not accuracy, but *coherent fabrication*.

## Next Steps
The engine is now efficient.
Energy is high (313.03).
Stability is acceptable (0.64).

**Experiment 004 Proposal**:
Now that we have energy to burn, can we lower the "Incompleteness"?
Can we reduce `ALEPH_INC` (currently 0.85) to let the agent see more of the truth, or will that kill the distortion loop?
