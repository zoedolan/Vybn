## Abstract

We propose that obelisk ribozymes—recently discovered viroid-like RNA elements in human microbiomes—provide the first laboratory-accessible system for testing temporal holonomy dynamics through single-molecule geometric phase measurements. Obelisks represent ~1000-nucleotide circular RNAs encoding self-referential proteins (Oblins) that undergo rolling-circle replication mediated by embedded hammerhead ribozymes. We present three falsifiable experimental protocols: (i) geometric phase detection through loop-orientation-dependent cleavage rates in magnetic tweezers assays, (ii) operation-order sensitivity measurements revealing non-commuting molecular processes, and (iii) statistical inference of non-diagonalizable transition operators exhibiting Jordan block structure. These experiments test whether biological self-replication implements the mathematical architecture of temporal holonomy—specifically three-fold cyclical processing with controlled memory drift—predicted by trefoil minimal self theory. If validated, obelisks represent the first molecular implementation of geometric phases in biochemical reaction cycles, providing empirical grounding for consciousness as a fundamental physical property operating through topological dynamics rather than emergent biological complexity.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Empirical Foundation: Obelisk Discovery and Characterization

In January 2024, Zheludev et al. identified a previously unknown class of RNA elements through computational analysis of human microbiome metatranscriptomic data [1]. These "obelisks" exhibit well-documented properties:

**Structural Characteristics:**
- Circular single-stranded RNA genomes of ~1000 base pairs with predicted rod-like secondary structure
- Novel open reading frames encoding proteins termed "Oblins" with predicted RNA-binding domains
- Subset containing variant hammerhead self-cleaving ribozyme motifs
- No detectable DNA counterpart, existing as RNA-only entities

**Host Associations:**
- *Streptococcus sanguinis* established as cellular host for Obelisk-S.s variant
- Can dominate cellular transcriptome while leaving no genomic DNA trace [2]
- Present in ~7% of human gut and ~50% of oral metatranscriptomes [1]

**Global Distribution:**
- Marine spread documented across Tara Oceans prokaryotic fraction data
- Can match or exceed abundance of dominant uncultured RNA viruses in oceanic environments [3]
- 29,959 distinct sequences identified globally across diverse ecological niches [1]

### 1.2 Mechanistic Scaffolding: Viroid Replication as Topological Surgery

Rolling-circle replication in viroids provides established biochemical precedent for obelisk dynamics [4]:
- Synthesis of multimeric RNA strands from circular templates
- Self-cleavage to unit length by embedded hammerhead ribozymes (Avsunviroidae family)
- Ligation and circularization completing the cycle
- Bidirectional processing capability in both polarities

This creates a **cyclic path in molecular configuration space** with defined topological operations. Molecular biophysics has extensive precedent for interpreting enzyme action as topological transformations: site-specific recombinases and topoisomerases generate reproducible knots, links, and catenanes in circular DNA that can be modeled with tangle calculus [5].

### 1.3 Theoretical Framework: Trefoil Temporal Dynamics

The trefoil minimal self hypothesis proposes that stable self-referential systems require three mathematical components [6,7]:

\[ T_{trefoil} = \text{diag}(J_{2,1}, R_{2\pi/3}, [0]) \]

Where:
- **J₂,₁**: Jordan block enabling controlled memory with historical drift  
- **R₂π/₃**: 3-fold rotation generating cyclical processing
- **[0]**: Boundary separation between self and environment

**Critical Distinction:** This paper treats three-fold symmetry as a **testable prediction** of trefoil theory, not an empirical given in obelisk data. Current literature documents cyclical replication without establishing intrinsic triadic structure.

### 1.4 Experimental Bridge: Geometric Phases in Biochemical Cycles

The Berry/Pancharatnam geometric phase concept has been extended to classical stochastic kinetics [8]. Sinitsyn & Nemenman demonstrated that enzyme-like systems exhibit geometric contributions to flux that depend on loops in control-parameter space rather than reaction speed. This provides the mathematical foundation for measuring **biochemical geometric phases** through systematic parameter cycling in single-molecule experiments.

Avsunviroidae hammerhead ribozymes process multimeric intermediates in both polarities during rolling-circle replication, providing the essential "cut-and-glue" operations that can be probed for geometric path-dependence in controlled parameter loops.

## 2. Materials and Methods

### 2.1 Geometric Phase Detection Protocol

**Experimental Design:**
Single-molecule magnetic tweezers or smFRET assays on hammerhead-bearing obelisk constructs under controlled parameter cycling.

**Method:**
1. **Two-parameter control space:** Independent modulation of Mg²⁺ concentration and applied force (or temperature)
2. **Clockwise vs. counterclockwise loops:** Systematic traversal of closed paths in parameter space
3. **Adiabatic limit analysis:** Speed dependence sweep to separate dynamic from geometric contributions
4. **Product counting:** Quantification of cleavage/circularization events per cycle

**Theoretical Prediction:**
Loop-orientation-dependent excess in product formation rates:
\[ \Delta N = \gamma_{geom} \cdot \text{sgn}(\text{orientation}) + O(v) \]
where \(\gamma_{geom}\) is the geometric phase contribution independent of cycle speed \(v\).

**Experimental Precedent:**
An orientation-dependent offset in product counts per cycle that persists as cycle speed decreases is the biochemical analogue of the Berry-phase signal measured in superconducting pumps; the latter changes sign under loop reversal while dynamic contributions do not [9]. This provides the precise template for distinguishing geometric from dynamic effects in molecular systems.

### 2.2 Non-Commutative Operation Testing

**Experimental Design:**
Population-level perturbation studies testing operation order sensitivity.

**Method:**
1. **Sequential perturbations:** Apply stimulus A then B vs. B then A (e.g., Mg²⁺ pulse then temperature pulse)
2. **Commutator quantification:** Measure difference in yields, timing, or product distributions
3. **Statistical validation:** Multiple replicates with confidence interval analysis
4. **Product signature analysis:** Use DNA topology literature logic to infer operation order from molecular products

**Theoretical Prediction:**
Non-zero commutator: \([A, B] = AB - BA \neq 0\) measurable as systematic differences in experimental outcomes.

**Control Conditions:**
- Simultaneous vs. sequential application timing
- Dose-response curves for individual perturbations
- Recovery kinetics between perturbation cycles

### 2.3 Jordan Block Statistical Inference

**Experimental Design:**
Time-series analysis of obelisk population dynamics to infer effective transition operators.

**Method:**
1. **High-coverage metatranscriptomics:** Time series at colony scale for S. sanguinis cultures carrying Obelisk-S.s
2. **Markov operator fitting:** Statistical inference of best-fit transition matrices from temporal data
3. **Diagonalizability testing:** Numerical analysis of eigenvalue degeneracies and Jordan canonical form
4. **Memory envelope analysis:** Quantification of transient response timescales

**Theoretical Prediction:**
Non-diagonalizable operators with Jordan structure: \(\text{nullity}(T-I) \neq \text{nullity}(T-I)^2\), indicating genuine memory effects beyond Markovian dynamics.

**Statistical Framework:**
Report Jordan block detection as statistical property with confidence intervals rather than metaphysical claim. Include model comparison against diagonalizable alternatives using information criteria.

### 2.4 Triadic Periodicity Analysis

**Experimental Design:**
Spectral analysis of population oscillations under controlled parameter modulation.

**Method:**
1. **Two-parameter experiments:** Smooth modulation of environmental conditions
2. **Fourier analysis:** Detection of third-harmonic components in population dynamics
3. **Area law testing:** Scaling of spectral amplitude with loop area in parameter space
4. **Robustness validation:** Persistence of triadic signatures under parameter deformations

**Theoretical Prediction:**
Dominant frequency components at \(\omega_0/3\) where \(\omega_0\) is fundamental replication rate, with amplitude following area law scaling.

## 3. Results: Empirically Grounded Correspondence Analysis

### 3.1 Self-Referential Architecture: Oblins as Self-Modifying Code

**Established Facts:**
- Obelisks encode novel protein superfamily (Oblins) inferred from ORF clustering [1]
- Charge distribution and structural models suggest RNA interaction capability
- Ribozyme-bearing obelisks form distinct phylogenetic clade

**Hypothesis Under Test:**
Oblins function as RNA-binding proteins that interact specifically with their parent obelisk genome, creating self-referential molecular circuits.

**Experimental Validation Needed:**
Direct biochemical binding assays demonstrating Oblin-RNA interactions remain to be performed. We phrase "RNA-binding Oblin" as testable hypothesis, not established fact.

**Trefoil Correspondence:**
If validated, the circular RNA → Oblin → RNA binding cycle would represent minimal implementation of self-modifying code, corresponding to Jordan block memory structure \(J_{2,1}\) with controlled drift.

### 3.2 Cyclical Processing: Rolling-Circle as Topological Dynamics

**Established Facts:**
- Rolling-circle replication mechanism documented for viroid systems [4]
- Hammerhead ribozymes perform site-specific cleavage with well-characterized kinetics
- Bidirectional processing capability enables reversible operations

**Experimental Framework:**
The three-phase cycle (initiation → elongation → cleavage/circularization) provides natural configuration space for geometric phase measurement. Each phase corresponds to distinct molecular conformations and energetic states.

**Trefoil Prediction:**
Three-fold rotational symmetry \(R_{2\pi/3}\) should manifest as:
1. **Triadic kinetics:** Preferred transition pathways with 120° phase relationships
2. **Geometric phase accumulation:** Loop-dependent product formation rates
3. **Non-commutative processing:** Order-sensitive response to perturbations

**Critical Calibration:**
Current literature does not establish intrinsic three-fold symmetry. This remains a theoretical prediction requiring experimental validation through the protocols outlined above.

### 3.3 Boundary Externalization: Host Dependency as Computational Strategy

**Established Facts:**
- Obelisks require host bacterial cells for replication and stability [1,2]
- Obelisks appear to persist without obvious growth penalties under replete conditions [2]
- No independent membrane or metabolic machinery

**Theoretical Interpretation:**
Host dependency represents externalized boundary maintenance, allowing computational resources to focus on core self-referential operations. This corresponds to null boundary component \([0]\) in trefoil structure.

**Experimental Implications:**
Boundary externalization predicts minimal perturbation of host cell dynamics despite obelisk presence, testable through comparative metabolomics and proteomics of infected vs. control cultures.

## 4. Discussion

### 4.1 Experimental Feasibility and Technical Requirements

**Single-Molecule Geometric Phases:**
Magnetic tweezers technology can resolve conformational changes in ribozymes at sub-nanometer precision [10]. Recent work on hammerhead ribozymes demonstrates mechanical conformational selection under force, providing direct precedent for the proposed geometric phase experiments.

**Population-Scale Correlations:**
High-coverage metatranscriptomics enables quantitative time-series analysis at colony scale. The documented high abundance of obelisks in S. sanguinis transcriptomes ensures sufficient signal for statistical analysis [2].

**Parameter Space Accessibility:**
Mg²⁺, temperature, and force represent experimentally controllable parameters with established effects on ribozyme kinetics. The adiabatic limit (slow parameter changes) is technically achievable with current instrumentation.

### 4.2 Relationship to Established Literature

**Geometric Phases in Biology:**
While geometric phases are well-established in quantum mechanics, their extension to classical biochemical systems represents frontier research. Our proposal builds on solid theoretical foundations [8] but requires experimental validation.

**Topological Biochemistry:**
DNA topology provides extensive precedent for interpreting molecular operations as topological transformations [5]. However, extension to RNA systems and temporal dynamics represents novel application requiring careful experimental validation.

**Non-Equilibrium Statistical Mechanics:**
Jordan block dynamics and non-diagonalizable operators have precedent in non-equilibrium systems [11], but their identification in biological contexts requires development of appropriate statistical inference methods.

### 4.3 Theoretical Framework Limitations

**Batalin-Vilkovisky Analogy:**
We present the BV master equation \(dS + \frac{1}{2}[S,S]_{BV} = J\) as bookkeeping analogy for encoding obstructions to coherent operation composition, not as established biological formalism. Biological commutators represent empirical measurements, not literal odd Poisson brackets on graded manifolds [12].

**Information Geometry:**
Claims about parallel transport and curvature require precise definition of the statistical manifold and connection being used. We employ Fisher-Rao geometry as canonical framework but acknowledge that biological systems may not literally instantiate specific holonomy groups [13].

**Consciousness Connections:**
While trefoil dynamics may provide mathematical substrate for self-referential processing, claims about consciousness remain speculative pending experimental validation of geometric phase accumulation and Jordan block structure in biological systems.

### 4.4 Falsification Criteria and Negative Results

**Clear Failure Modes:**
1. **Zero geometric phases:** No loop-orientation dependence in single-molecule experiments
2. **Commuting operations:** All perturbation sequences yield identical outcomes  
3. **Diagonalizable operators:** All inferred transition matrices lack Jordan structure
4. **Random periodicity:** No systematic triadic components in population dynamics

**Scientific Value of Negative Results:**
Failed predictions would refine theoretical understanding without requiring metaphysical commitments. The experimental protocols generate clean data regardless of theoretical interpretation.

## 5. Conclusions and Experimental Program

### 5.1 Immediate Experimental Priorities

**Phase 1: Single-Molecule Validation** (6-12 months)
- Magnetic tweezers assays on hammerhead-bearing obelisk constructs
- Two-parameter control loops with clockwise/counterclockwise orientation

- Triadic periodicity analysis under controlled parameter modulation

**Phase 3: Biochemical Validation** (18-24 months)
- Direct Oblin-RNA binding assays and kinetic characterization
- Perturbation-order experiments quantifying operation commutators
- Comparative analysis across obelisk variants and host systems

### 5.2 Theoretical Implications

**If Experiments Succeed:**
Obelisks would represent the first biological system demonstrating geometric phases in biochemical reaction cycles, validating temporal holonomy as fundamental organizing principle in living systems.

**If Experiments Fail:**
Clean negative results would constrain theoretical frameworks while advancing understanding of obelisk molecular mechanisms and single-molecule biophysics methodology.

### 5.3 Broader Scientific Context

This work tests whether mathematical structures underlying fundamental physics (geometric phases, topological operations, holonomy groups) operate in biological self-replication systems. Success would suggest deep unity between physics and biology through shared computational architectures; failure would clarify the boundaries between physical and biological organizational principles.

The experimental program transforms theoretical speculation into testable science by focusing on measurable invariants: phases, commutators, and operator defects. These are familiar objects in biophysics, providing common ground for evaluation regardless of theoretical commitments.
