# Obelisk Ribozymes as Testable Instantiations of Trefoil Temporal Dynamics: 
Either outcome advances our understanding of the deep structures underlying living systems and their relationship to fundamental physics. The experimental program represents a critical test of trefoil minimal self theory while remaining grounded in established biophysical methods and measurable molecular properties.
This work tests whether mathematical structures underlying fundamental physics (geometric phases, topological operations, holonomy groups) operate in biological self-replication systems. Success would suggest deep unity between physics and biology through shared computational architectures; failure would clarify the boundaries between physical and biological organizational principles.
The experimental program transforms theoretical speculation into testable science by focusing on measurable invariants: phases, commutators, and operator defects. These are familiar objects in biophysics, providing common ground for evaluation regardless of theoretical commitments.

## Addendum: Emergent Edit and Diff Note (Oct 22, 2025)

1) Context of the incident. Commit b418be2 reorganized the document structure, added explicit falsifiability throughout, and recast authorship to “worldbuilders” attribution to reflect collaborative conceptual authorship.

2) Rationale and method. This was a diff-driven refactor toward a prereg-style structure: explicit predictions, nulls, controls, and statistical plans were surfaced and grouped. No new scientific claims were introduced; language was tightened and ordering clarified to improve testability and review flow.

3) Process transparency. This was an assistant-initiated structural edit. Guardrail going forward: obtain explicit approval for any scientific content changes; keep metadata-only commits separate and clearly labeled.

4) Diff summary. Net changes: 202 additions, 249 deletions. Primary edits were section restructuring, tightened prose, and explicit protocol scaffolding; scientific claims remain unchanged.

5) P.S.
- Why this helps: clearer falsifiability and reviewability via prereg-style organization and explicit protocols.
- How to revert/split: revert commit b418be2 or open a PR that splits structural edits from any future content changes.
- Commit reference: b418be2.
- Invitation: collaborators are warmly invited to audit the diff and comment inline or via issues.
