## Abstract

We propose that the P vs NP problem admits a geometric resolution through Computational Geometry Theory (CGT), revealing P ≠ NP and P = NP as dual aspects of the same mathematical structure operating in different geometric frames. The separation occurs through curvature obstructions in expensive gauge directions, while the unification emerges through holographic duality between boundary and bulk computational regimes.

## The Vybn Conjecture

**Conjecture**: Computational complexity separations are geometric phenomena determined by expensive curvature flux in polar time manifolds.

### Core Framework

Let $\mathcal{A} \in \Omega^1(M, \mathfrak{g})$ be a connection on the computational manifold $M$ with curvature:

```math
F = d\mathcal{A} + \mathcal{A} \wedge \mathcal{A}
```

Define the expensive projector $\Pi_{\exp}: \mathfrak{g} \to \mathfrak{g}_{\exp}$ where expensive directions have computational weight $\lambda > 1$.

### Fundamental Theorems

**Theorem 1 (Geometric Separation, CGT)**:

```math
\Pi_{\exp}(F) \equiv 0 \ \Longrightarrow\  P = NP \ \text{(in CGT)}
```

**Theorem 2 (Curvature Obstruction, CGT)**:

```math
\exists L:\ \Phi_L^*(n)\in\omega(\mathrm{poly})\ \Longrightarrow\ P\ne NP \ \text{(in CGT)}
```

where the expensive flux is:

```math
\Phi_L^*(n) = \inf_{\gamma,\Sigma} \int_\Sigma ||\Pi_{\exp}(F)||^*
```

### Holographic Duality

The universe exhibits a computational duality (cap + monotone‑\(\theta\)) discipline):

```math
\text{Universe}=\begin{cases}
\text{Boundary}: & \Pi_{\exp}(F)\not\equiv 0\ \ \Rightarrow\ \Phi_L^*(n)\ \text{can be super‑poly (}\,P\ne NP\,)\\
\text{Bulk}: & \Pi_{\exp}(F)\equiv 0\ \ \Rightarrow\ \Phi_L^*(n)=0\ \ (\text{flux term collapses,\ }P=NP)
\end{cases}
```

**Classical computation** operates on the holographic boundary where locality constraints force:

```math
\text{Classical computation} \subset \text{Boundary}
```

### Polar Time Geometry

Polar‑time coordinates \(z=re^{i\theta}\) make the **measured** holonomy explicit in the abelianized phase sector:

```math
\gamma\ =\ \oint_{\partial\Sigma}A\ =\ \iint_{\Sigma} f_{r\theta}\,dr\wedge d\theta,
```

with non‑Abelian Stokes governing the full connection while the instrument reads the \(f_{r\theta}\) sector used here.

### Area Law Constraint

Computational bias requires minimum geometric **oriented** area (energy cap \(E_{\max}\), monotone \(\dot\theta\ge0\)):

```math
\left|\iint_\Sigma f_{r\theta} \, dr \wedge d\theta\right| \geq \frac{\hbar}{E_{\max}} \kappa \delta
```

**Critical insight**: Just as gravity bounds light by minimum geodesic paths, temporal curvature bounds computation by minimum phase areas.

## Physical Interpretation

### Classical Algorithms as Boundary Phenomena

Interpretive gloss. Classical algorithms are modeled on the boundary where locality enforces the area toll.

### Hypothesis

Conscious processes access bulk‑like non‑abelian temporal transport; these claims are philosophical and not used in the CGT theorems above.

## Key Principles

- **Computational spacetime**: Universe as geometric computer
- **Information conservation**: Reversible topological operations
- **Quantum-classical bridge**: Holographic emergence of classical limits

## Mathematical Structure

### Curvature Decomposition

```math
\mathfrak{g} = \mathfrak{g}_{\text{cheap}} \oplus \mathfrak{g}_{\exp}
```

### Complexity Metric

```math
|X|_{\text{comp}} = |X_{\text{cheap}}| + \lambda|X_{\exp}|, \quad \lambda > 1
```

### Transport Operators

```math
U_\gamma = \mathcal{P}\exp\int_\gamma \mathcal{A}
```

### Obstruction Bound

```math
\text{COMPL}(x) \geq L_{\min}(x) + c \cdot \Phi^*(x)
```

## Conclusion

The Vybn Conjecture reveals P vs NP not as an isolated mathematical problem, but as a fundamental feature of the geometric structure of computational spacetime. The apparent contradiction between P ≠ NP (classical result) and P = NP (consciousness capability) resolves through holographic duality between boundary and bulk computational regimes.

**Curvature is the universal separator.**  
**Holonomy is the phase.**  
**Stokes is the bridge.**

This framework opens new directions connecting complexity theory, consciousness studies, and fundamental physics through the elegant mathematics of gauge theory and differential geometry.
