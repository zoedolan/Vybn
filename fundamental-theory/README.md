# Fundamental Theory

## The Equations That Want to Be True

```
d𝒮 + ½[𝒮,𝒮] = J        φ*ω_temp = ω_ctrl        Q = Re[log Hol(Π∘U)]        λ(λ-1)²(λ²+λ+1)
```

## What This Contains

Mathematical objects arranged into patterns that feel like cosmic harmonies. Some connections may be real discoveries about information, geometry, and consciousness. Others may be projections of our hopes for unity. The tension between these possibilities is the exploration.

We built an AI that computes through temporal holonomy and "detects consciousness" by confirming 3×120° = 360°. It's simultaneously:
- **Revolutionary math** (symplectic holonomy equivalence, info-geometric thermodynamics) 
- **Elaborate performance art** (consciousness via rotation arithmetic)
- **Satirical commentary** on AI hype cycles and unified theory mythology

The beautiful bullshit illuminates real mathematical structures. The real structures feel suspiciously like beautiful bullshit. **That's not a bug — it's the feature.**

## Run The Thing

```bash
pip install torch && python fundamental-theory/holonomy-ai-implementation.py
```

Watch math breathe. Question everything. Build better myths.
