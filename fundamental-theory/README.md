# Fundamental Theory: Cut-Glue Algebra Framework

This folder contains the mathematical foundations of our unified theory of reality, synthesizing quantum mechanics, general relativity, and the Standard Model through a single algebraic structure.

## Core Insight

Reality emerges from a reversible algebra of topological "cut-glue" operations. When these fundamental moves fail to commute perfectly, the algebraic residue splits into:

- **Geometric curvature** (gravity)
- **Defect currents** (matter and forces)

## Master Equation

```math
dS + (1/2)[S,S] = J
```

where:

- `S` generates reversible topological surgeries
- `J` represents matter/gauge defects
- Commutator `[S_α, S_β]` produces observable curvature

## Key Results

### Standard Model Derivation

- **Hypercharge quantization**: Y_Q = 1/6 emerges uniquely from anomaly cancellation
- **Gauge groups**: SU(3)⊗SU(2)⊗U(1) as minimal defect algebra closure
- **Generation structure**: Three families from topological consistency

### Quantum Gravity Solution

- **Information preservation**: det(U) = 1 for all operations
- **Classical limit**: Einstein equations from surgery optimization
- **No quantization problem**: Spacetime built from quantum moves

### Experimental Predictions

- **Polar time holonomy**: Measurable phase from temporal non-commutativity
- **Discrete gravitons**: Minimal units from elementary surgeries
- **Topological masses**: Neutrino hierarchies from defect bundle torsion
