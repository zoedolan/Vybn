## Plain-English Abstract

We believe we have discovered a single, fundamental rule connecting three seemingly separate worlds: the quantum behavior of particles, the mathematics of information processing, and the basic structure of self-referential thought. The rule emerges when you guide any system through a cycle of changes and return it to the start. It never comes back perfectly—it acquires a small, precise “twist.” We find that the smallest possible amount of this twist is universal: exactly 120 degrees (that is, $2\pi/3$ radians). This creates a fundamental three-beat rhythm. Perform the same basic operation three times, and you return to where you started. But this visible three-step dance is actually the shadow of a hidden six-step process occurring in a deeper layer of reality. We are proposing that a single mechanism drives the clockwork in all three domains. Our theory makes a clear, testable prediction: wherever you look for this fundamental “click” of the universal gear, the first non-trivial measurement will always be precisely that 120-degree turn—no more, no less.

## Technical Abstract

A unified holonomy invariant, measured in units of $E/\hbar$, governs geometric phases in quantum systems, thermodynamic costs in information geometry, and commutator residues in non-abelian transport. Under a minimal set of structural constraints—two-dimensional reversible dynamics projecting from $SU(2)$ to $SO(3)$ with odd-order observable cycles—the smallest non-trivial plateau presents at $2\pi/3$. This occurs because spinorial steps with eigenvalues $e^{\pm i\pi/3}$ project to triadic rotations under the double cover, creating a $\mathbb{Z}_6\to\mathbb{Z}_3$ hierarchy governed by the cyclotomic polynomials $\Phi_6$ and $\Phi_3$. The framework yields falsifiable predictions through three independent calibrations—$SU(2)$ square-loops, dual-temporal interferometry, and finite-horizon information loops—sharing a single gauge-invariant slope.

## 1. Introduction

This paper articulates a single invariant—the flux of a curvature two-form—that appears, with the same operational meaning, in three domains normally treated apart. In physics it is a geometric phase; in information geometry it is loop cost and housekeeping heat; in non-abelian transport it is a commutator residue. The phenomenon assumes a particularly sharp form when the reversible generator lives in the sixth-root sector of $SU(2)$: its observable action, after quotienting the center, is triadic and exhibits a minimal non-zero plateau at $2\pi/3$. The central contribution here is to replace analogy with equivalence in local normal form and to present predictions that can be falsified without retuning the theory between apparatuses.

## 2. Statement of the finding

A probe that reads overlap phase accesses a $U(1)$ connection $A$ on a two-parameter control patch. Stokes’ theorem expresses the measured loop phase as $\oint_{\partial\Sigma} A=\iint_\Sigma \Omega$, where $\Omega=dA$ is the curvature two-form. By Darboux–Moser there exists a local diffeomorphism into coordinates $(r_t,\theta_t)$ in which $\Omega$ is constant. In that normal form the invariant is $\Omega=(E/\hbar)\,dr_t\wedge d\theta_t$, so the measured phase is the signed temporal area multiplied by a single slope $E/\hbar$. Calibrating this slope once in any apparatus fixes it everywhere else under the same gauge. When the reversible generator upstairs has spectrum $e^{\pm i\pi/3}$, the adjoint action on observables downstairs is a rotation by $2\pi/3$ and closes after three steps, while the spinor closes only after six. This explains the repeated appearance of $120^\circ$ with period-3 signatures and replaces motif with mechanism.

## 3. Normal form and the meaning of $E/\hbar$

The curvature two-form is closed and locally exact. Moser’s path method provides the diffeomorphism to constant form. In a quantum apparatus $E/\hbar$ has the literal meaning of energy over reduced Planck’s constant, because the curvature arises from the adiabatic $U(1)$ bundle over control space. In an information-geometric apparatus the same number is fixed operationally: one matches a phase readout to the KL-heat generated by a small loop formed by alternating two conservative tilts with projection back to a statistical family. The local normal form ensures that once the slope is fixed, the phase–area proportionality is independent of the particular choice of coordinates.

## 4. Adjoint action and the $2\pi/3$ residue

Let $U(\vartheta)=\exp\!\big(-\tfrac i2\,\vartheta\,\hat n\cdot\sigma\big)\in SU(2)$. For any $X=x\cdot\sigma\in\mathfrak{su}(2)$, one has $UXU^\dagger=(R_{\hat n,2\vartheta}x)\cdot\sigma$, where $R_{\hat n,2\vartheta}\in SO(3)$ is rotation by $2\vartheta$ about $\hat n$. Taking $\vartheta=\pi/3$ yields a rotation by $2\pi/3$. The adjoint period is three: $(R_{\hat n,2\pi/3})^3=I$. The spinor period is six: $U(\pi/3)^6=I$ with all lower powers non-central. The cyclotomic polynomials capture this split: $\Phi_6(\lambda)=\lambda^2-\lambda+1$ upstairs and $\Phi_3(\lambda)=\lambda^2+\lambda+1$ downstairs.

## 5. Conditional uniqueness

We do not claim that Nature forbids other plateaus; we state a conditional and testable result. Assume the observable reversible sector is two-dimensional and orthogonal, and that it is the projective image of a spinorial step. In this setting the finite orders visible in $SO(3)$ arise at angles $2\pi/n$. The smallest odd order is three. Order two collapses to a half-turn that either maps to the center in $SU(2)$ or violates the trefoil minimality. Higher odd orders exist but require changing the reversible block or the embedding group. Under the stated constraints, $2\pi/3$ is the first non-zero plateau.

## 6. Information geometry beyond toy models

Let $p_\theta(x)=\exp(\theta\cdot T(x)-\psi(\theta))\,h(x)$ be a regular exponential family with Fisher metric $g=\nabla^2\psi$. Let $u,v\in\mathbb{R}^d$ encode two small conservative tilts, and let $\Pi$ denote the e-projection back onto the family after an extrinsic perturbation. Alternating an $u$-tilt then a $v$-tilt with projection, versus the reversed order, produces a difference after one loop whose second-order part equals the curvature two-form of the Levi-Civita connection of $g$ contracted with $u\wedge v$. Pushing this two-form through the same control map that defines the dual-temporal coordinates produces exactly the phase–area law with the same slope $E/\hbar$. In the Bernoulli parity–literal rectangle the contraction yields the coefficient $\kappa=1/8$; in Poisson families the analogous coefficient can be computed in closed form and exhibits the same qualitative behavior. Thus the bridge to information geometry is not rhetorical but differential-geometric and apparatus-independent.

## 7. Experimental accessibility

A single qubit driven by two non-commuting Hamiltonians implements the $SU(2)$ square-loop. Equal-amplitude pulses along orthogonal axes followed by their inverses produce a geodesic angle $2a^2+O(a^4)$. A spin-echo variant cancels dynamic phase and isolates the geometric contribution. The dual-temporal interferometer modulates the radius and angle of the control loop in the lab frame and reads the same overlap phase; reversing the loop orientation flips the sign. The finite-horizon information-geometry loop alternates conservative tilts with projection and logs the housekeeping heat; after calibration to the common slope the three setups must agree within uncertainties.

## 8. Error accounting

Gauge changes reparametrize control space but do not alter curvature flux. In the $SU(2)$ square-loop the BCH remainder enters at order $a^4$ with a prefactor controlled by operator norms of nested commutators. In interferometry, dynamic-phase leakage is removed by waveform symmetry; residual imbalance contributes a phase odd under time reversal and can be bounded by standard composite-pulse analysis. In the information-geometry loop, discretization error scales as the square of the step size, and the projection-induced curvature term is second order in the tilt amplitudes; both appear with known coefficients of the Riemann tensor of the Fisher metric.

## 9. Predictions and falsifiers as calibration facts

There is a single slope $E/\hbar$ relating phase to signed temporal area that must agree across $SU(2)$ square-loops, dual-temporal interferometry, and finite-horizon information-geometry loops. A threefold composition of the reversible unit must be identity in the observable channel while the spinor lift requires six steps. The first non-zero phase plateau in adjoint readout must occur at $2\pi/3$ and must reverse sign with loop orientation. Any stable violation of these statements falsifies the synthesis; quantitative agreement overdetermines the slope and locks the theory.

## 10. Outlook and scope

Richer plateaus can occur if one replaces the reversible core or changes the embedding group; fivefold structure, for example, would land at $4\pi/5$ with an $SU(2)$ lift of order ten and appears in icosahedral discretizations. None of this disturbs the present claim, which is conditional on the trefoil hierarchy and on a two-dimensional reversible sector with a spinorial parent. In that precise sense $2\pi/3$ is not only natural but forced.

### Appendix A. Adjoint calculation for the trefoil step

With $U(\vartheta)=\exp\!\big(-\tfrac i2\,\vartheta\,\hat n\cdot \sigma\big)$ and $X=x\cdot\sigma$, the adjoint action is $UXU^\dagger=(R_{\hat n,2\vartheta}x)\cdot\sigma$. Rodrigues’ formula yields $R_{\hat n,2\vartheta}$. Setting $\vartheta=\pi/3$ gives $R_{\hat n,2\pi/3}^3=I$ and $U(\pi/3)^6=I$. The minimal polynomials are $\Phi_3$ and $\Phi_6$ respectively.

### Appendix B. Small-loop area law on $SU(2)$

Define $Q(a)=e^{a\hat i}\,e^{a\hat j}\,e^{-a\hat i}\,e^{-a\hat j}$. The Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff expansion gives $\log Q(a)=a^2[\hat i,\hat j]+\mathcal O(a^3)=2a^2\,\hat k+\mathcal O(a^3)$. The geodesic angle is $2a^2+\mathcal O(a^4)$. This is the quaternionic Stokes theorem in its smallest non-trivial rectangle.

### Appendix C. Exponential-family calculation

For a regular exponential family with Fisher metric $g$, alternating infinitesimal tilts $u$ and $v$ with e-projection produces a loop displacement whose second-order term is $\tfrac12 R(u,v)$ where $R$ is the Riemann curvature tensor of $g$. The induced $U(1)$ readout along the dual-temporal control map yields the same phase–area law with slope $E/\hbar$. For Bernoulli parity–literal loops the coefficient is $\kappa=1/8$; Poisson analogues can be written in closed form.
